{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-24?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members it's Bob Lucas on April the 24th hope you're doing really well so I have a bit of a change in format now going forward the Friday lightning report was just getting far too big for me to handle too many requests and I think a lot of the coins were simply not coins that people were necessarily following so what I'm going to do here is change the Wednesday which Wednesday report which has been typically a midweek update on Bitcoin and some of the other majors that may be moving and make that a top 10 market report so Monday will be the full Bitcoin cycles report going over the daily and weekly chart Wednesday will now be the top 10 coin report where I cover the top 10 coins and then Friday's lightning report will be 15 coins 15 maybe to 20 at the most of coins outside of the top 10 and they can be any market cap based on feedback from you and what you want to see so I will be monitoring the comment section for now going forward let's start with this post and the comments in that post and the requests that you have in terms of looking at altcoins and seeing where there may be some opportunity so please post your requests in the comments I will also skim through before the report my list that I've gone through in the past for lightning reports and take a look at anything that I believe is of interest so something that could be a potential setup something that should be on your watch list something that has the room or the opportunity to go to go higher so that's the new format I think that's going to work a lot better than sort of a 40 or 50 minute lightning report this way I'll get to spend a little more time on the analysis as well and especially the top 10 here I'll get a chance to be more focused on those coins going forward because there will be a weekly recurring deeper dive into those okay so that's the update I will just use coin market caps US dollar coin market cap to to find the top 10 obviously tether will not be part of that so number 11 tron will be part of the top 10 and today I'll go through each of those for you as well as bitcoin sit back and enjoy okay the btc update well bitcoin I think still looks great to me we are touching the upper and actually have exceeded the upper bollinger bands we had this tightening rising but tightening uh process over the last few weeks I said on Monday that I liked this setup I thought this can still go higher and indeed on Tuesday we did go considerably higher another sort of 200 higher so this is still trending higher coming back today and it could go back a few more days but um the fact that we are comfortably above the 10 and 20 day moving average riding the upper bollinger bands still relatively I wouldn't call it early in the cycle but at least before the typical midpoint of the cycle I think that overall is a reason to at least remain bullish here or at least expect to continue the uptrend until we see evidence that that uptrend is no longer in play while price remains in this type of trend you want to respect that you want to either be just uh long from a from a long-term position and not necessarily leverage but you don't want to be looking for shorts picking tops in any uptrend is a mugs game or a losers game don't don't fall for that it is it is a a nice feeling to think that you may be able to pick tops in an uptrend but um you know trust me it it it you will get one eventually and you'll feel good about it but in the long run you'll get cut to death trying to short a market that is rallying at this best to wait for a nice trend lower to emerge whether it's late in the cycle to short otherwise you want to be riding with the trend at this time at the moment it's still higher now if the cycle low was right here on the day 47 then today marks day 30 which is around the midpoint so we are getting kind of into that danger period or the period where it could start to turn lower but again we still need to see evidence that it's going to turn lower we still have we have for god's sake five month highs right here on this candle uh yesterday so uh with five month highs just in place you don't want to be shorting the market at this point all right let's take a look at ethereum here don't like what i saw overnight i was liking the action a couple days ago but really thinking now that my long ethereum trade is going to get stopped out here such as the nature of the markets but the fact that we dropped back below the 10 and 20 day moving average um when it should have continued higher from right this area here after after retracing the breakout point i think coming back a second time to the breakout point is not a good sign at all so um not looking good here i think it still has a final chance it's really going to move today or tomorrow to be honest with you not looking good i think by friday we're either going to be closed out or stopped out or sharply higher at that point i don't think it's going to i don't think it's going to hang around this area for too much longer the bollinger bands are starting to get really tight and i think it's either going to break down pretty sharply and come back down to the 140 area or it's going to break considerably higher at this point something to watch out for but uh yeah just unfortunately just not not following through and that's the way markets um you know markets behave it sometimes just got to look back at it and say well you know was the chart pattern correct was my entry correct was my risk defined well if all those boxes are ticked correctly then it's just a matter of accepting what the market gives us and then looking at ethereum to btc see this here is part of the problem as well we are now uh breaking lower uh i'm not sure if we have new lows necessarily but um let's just draw across here no we're not well actually that bounced off perfectly almost so bounced off uh 029740973 okay so almost a double bottom here from uh this february low still nowhere near the december lows i think they're going to hold but it looks like here we are going to exceed this february low and come down lower so overall not exciting action here um from ethereum and i think this is also telling us a lot of what we're seeing on the uh the altcoin space in general where a lot of charts have broken down and we'll go over that on friday but many of the charts are now broken down uh i think whatever altcoin move we've had is now over for the time being i think we're looking at retracing but uh opportunities will come again of course but right now this looks like it's uh it's it's testing lower probably a bounce back up maybe something like this and then as we head lower into the next cycle low for bitcoin in may i think we may get down to kind of this area here by the end of may where the bitcoin cycle low is due and then we can build up again from there so at the moment not looking good here for ethereum going forward now i really wish i had shorted xrp ripple here i've pretty much been all over this move for i would say three months my analysis has been very consistent that we have a well-defined downtrend that you should respect that you should not buy and that you should not be taking a position thinking that you'll get this big spike up at any given time this is a perfect example of why you don't try and pick bottoms in a downtrend and you don't try and pick tops in an uptrend it's a fool's game as i said with the bitcoin analysis this is a downtrend and when it got to this area in march that downtrend begin began to accelerate lower now we're now we're putting in some deeper candles here i think it's probably oversold enough probably we'll get a bounce but again you don't play a bounce in this type of market because the downtrend the trend on the longer time frame intermediate time frame is still lower we've broken below this sort of arbitrary support line that i have here intersecting two prior points nothing significant about those two points we've had other periods like this one here where it's gone significantly lower i think there isn't much of an opportunity here unless we get down to this sort of 4 000 level on on ripple versus bitcoin um so you know and now that we're sort of seem to be capitulating almost that that decline could um could begin to really accelerate as it has more recently but almost become a complete sort of swan swan dive drop all the way down to the 4 000 area maybe down at this 4 000 area if it does find the bottom and reverse put in a swing low then maybe there's an opportunity to get long but right now this is something you want to avoid bitcoin cash abc um it's been performing well lately it's uh more than doubled against bitcoin of late it has somewhat of an uptrend in play but unfortunately if you look at more recent action here let's see if we can take a look at this so we had a top on this spike we had a retrace back towards the 10 20 day moving average that's great it tried to go higher again failed to make a new high and now has made a new low so that's a definition of a trend change right there so we have a high that did not make a higher high then we now have a breakdown and a low that's made a lower low so this has to be respected i think this is going to continue to come down low at this point this also has a lot to do with bitcoin's uh more more dominant run of late so this pair is probably showing more weakness because bitcoin is showing more strength than anything else and you probably will see that show up a little more here on the dollar chart see on the dollar chart we don't have a new high like same as bitcoin but yet we do not have a lower low and that's because bitcoin itself has performed really well as opposed to the dollar so versus the dollar this list is looking more a little bit more like a flag pattern tightening bollinger bands could go higher but you would probably still need bitcoin to come back a little bit i'm not sure if that's the case so this is kind of a neutral chart for me um if if bitcoin versus abc here had held the line as well then i would think this would be more bullish but this development here leads me to believe it's starting to break down a little bit as well and especially if bitcoin starts to find the top in this cycle a 60 day cycle the entire sector will get dragged down i think this will also suffer uh on on the bitcoin versus abc but also a bitcoin versus the dollar chart as well i think this would begin to break down so at the moment caution not a horrible looking chart overall um but certainly something to be cautious about and i don't really see much of an opportunity to trade this at this time okay eos i said uh before that this chart was looking good eos versus dollar that it was consolidating bounds again bands were getting tighter but it's gone the other way this also is uh something we're seeing across the board now in many of the altcoins eos is breaking down this is a sign uh now for long term i'm not phased at all this is a beautiful move off the dollar 50. i think this will come back now quite a bit maybe into this sort of cluster three dollar range not a reason to get out from a long-term perspective from a shorter term trading standpoint you want to be out now this is breaking down and not something you want to uh be long for from a trade standpoint eos btc is showing a more pronounced significant drop below any sort of level i said before that would be um something to get me out of so this is now and avoid do not be trading this at all eos is breaking down could retrace back kind of all the way down to this sort of level here even down to this initial point triangle point where it broke out uh anything's possible especially if the altcoin space is going to have another month or so down um you know i think i think people got very excited about the altcoin space recently pretty much put a lot of money and capital back to work and now i think this is taking some of that back all right litecoin very similar trends big up trends are now breaking down um another reason why we use stops right uh here's another point where i said if you're going to go long get long but you want to be out at that point if it breaks below lower and this is the reason why we use stops we always want to minimize our risk if you're still holding this then you know i don't know it could bounce back but you won't you don't want to be holding these if you're just trading these if you're going to be if you're if you're investing long term of course you don't care about these types of charts but if you're trading this then you should have been out right here minimize your losses you take it taking a small loss and move on right now you're holding the bag on a 15 20 loss here on the position and that hurts and it's probably hard to get out because of that my advice is just always cut your losses and get out if it's if it's gone beyond your initial plan because what happens is if it keeps going much lower than you and eventually end up puking that position because the losses are so steep that you can't handle it anymore so if you're in that position i would advise personally to to get out of it at the moment no trade here long it's come back a very long way it needs to re-establish some type of uptrend right now it's completely broken that trend it's below previous sort of consolidation areas where they rallied this would have been kind of the final straw area see right here um getting below that and even the wick that you saw on this massive candle here even that it's below that so nothing here of interest for litecoin it's now a broken uptrend and we don't know if this means that this trend will spend a period of time doing something like this okay over the next month or two before forming a new low this was a beautiful move but all beautiful moves at least in the short term intermediate trend come to an end and this one looks like it has come to an end okay binance coin is about the only coin that still has an uptrend in play but be careful with this right let's put in here so higher high that's the last high versus the most recent high versus the high before higher high that's great now you want to put in some point here on the recent low okay so that's your stop point right if it gets below that point you now have a trend change it's still looking pretty good it's at the 10 and 20 day moving average what concerns me though is that all the other coins and all the other majors have pretty much already broken down and this has had a very big move since november it hasn't really stopped going higher so at some point there's going to be some really significant profit taking you would think it's something like this it's up 400 and there's a lot of people who are sitting on some really fat gains on this and once the momentum changes and turns then you'll see a massive you know deceleration and sell off it doesn't mean it's bearish for binance in the longer term but everything has an ebb and flow action to it and at some point this will have a reversal back think of it like a pendulum swinging at some point once the pendulum reaches the other end it starts to come back and get and gather momentum that's what will happen eventually i'm not saying it's gonna happen now but based on the whole crypto space in general and how it's already turned you would want to you'd want to believe or you should believe that this is probably going to turn at some point at the moment still like the uptrend just keep keep you know be aware of some of these important areas certainly for breaks and closes on a daily below the 10 and 20 day moving average you should be concerned on this xlm i can't believe this is a top 10 coin but it is guys be careful of this this is not a good looking chart i think it's breaking down i think we're seeing the start of it right here we had this here it's more it's not a bear flag but um when the entire space rallies sharply and this barely made a you know i mean it's up 50 don't get me wrong but compared to everything else um it didn't do as much and now we have a 10 day moving average below the 20 it's touching the lower bollinger bands the entire space is breaking down uh i think this is going to go much lower it may even test in my opinion the february lows by the time this move is over with so be very careful with stella i do not like this at all cardano look at this guys all the way back to the breakout point okay and and there's a couple of things i just want to mention here and hopefully as being members of bitcoin live part of what we want to do and certainly what i want to do is not spoon feed ideas and trades that i'm doing necessarily but to teach you or to at least uh walk through the process and the thinking behind what i do and the trades i do that's the most important takeaway and what i said clearly and multiple times with ada was that we get in early on these chart identification patterns and we start to take our profit we took some profit up in this sort of 1600 and then somewhere around the 1800 area we took two-thirds of the profit on this banked a really good profit but some people i know this because i got some emails or some texts um some some dms i should say on asking what we should do um some people were kind of looking at this upper area i certainly was but i was looking at that upper area with a third a final third of my position not with my profits i took enough of the profits out where i didn't mind seeing this come back down lower obviously didn't want to see it come back lower but the point is that i was prepared for this lower by taking some profit early of course it's more of an art form than it is a science in terms of how much profit taken when you take it but the fact that you know when the market gives you something you want to take something off the table to allow you to then be able to weather something like this i think what some people end up doing here is some people didn't buy the initial break of this they bought this break here and now they're at break even and if they keep holding that full position now they're going to end up probably puking out at a loss when they sat on the 30 and 40 profit so just be aware of that uh if you are in that boat where you bought in at the breakout and have not sold anything then i got to be honest with you i think you start to get out here take your break even and and use that as a lesson because what's going to happen is or what could happen is this could continue higher all the way back down to this march and february lows and let's extend that out okay it could come back all the way to here and i think you would end up puking your position right probably when the market's going to turn so just be aware of that but look as analysis i don't necessarily like much about this and i think this is just again a symptom of the entire all coin space it's going through a correction at the moment and this could find support right here potentially at least maybe come back up for a few days like something like this right but then i think based on this it's going to come back down lower and break below that point so something to be aware of okay let's finish with coin number 10 on the market cap tron so overall this is a beautiful base right but again failed breakout here and now it came back down tried to come back up didn't do anything and is now breaking down touching the lower bollinger bands for the second time this like everything else is a warning i think if we go back and look at the february and march like we did ada i think we are looking at a retest of that zone let's draw that here so somewhere in this area here over the next coming month would probably be a good position again to trying and maybe establish a position and then we're looking at maybe a retest of this sort of neckline or this zone at least probably not until june or july on the next cycle and then maybe a break higher and above so for now this is an avoid long term again like anything else these are good positions to be in price wise but the charts are not showing any trade opportunity from a you know short and intermediate term time frame for tron okay guys let's finish with a little summary here summary is that bitcoin is performing well but the entire altcoin space is underperforming and actually in the corrective mode all the charts are bearish some of the altcoins that we're not covering today so the top sort of uh 10 to 30 market cap coins are showing horrible chart patterns be very aware guys you want to be um sitting on the sidelines for this let the market correct don't try and find bottoms in a downtrend this downtrend has only really just gotten started it hasn't um it hasn't really been in play for a significant amount of time yet even though there's pretty significant corrections already uh you see that i'm on the sidelines have been mostly on the sidelines for a number of weeks now for that very reason when the charts start breaking down then there just isn't a trade for me to have a lot of you are trying to force your hand on the market trying to force the situation and you have recency bias in mind meaning that you loved the uh the the uptrend of the last few months the the profits that you were showing at least on paper um and now you kind of uh longing for those days again and trying to pick up these uh these coins on pullbacks not the time for that i think we still have more of a pullback to come be patient sit in cash sit in bitcoin if you have to um and let's just wait for opportunities to present themselves they will come but we need to be selective and mindful and patient to be able to capitalize because what happens is it's so easy to make a good run a good profit in an altcoin run-up and it's so easy to give it all back and more okay so please think about that incorporate that into your strategy and incorporate that more into your thinking when you're looking for a trade ask yourself what am i doing here if i'm looking for something then i'm probably taking inferior setups and i'm taking a trade that's not ticking all of my boxes and you're taking a trade just for the sake of trading so try to avoid that and be mindful hopefully you like this new format the top 10 coin review on wednesdays give me your requests for all coins for the friday lightning report until then be well and happy trading", "source": "episode-2019-04-24"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-10?", "input": "", "output": "Hey good morning Bitcoin Live members it's Bob Lucas Wednesday morning in New York hope you're all doing really well this is your brief midweek update on the cycles had a full report out on Monday I suggest you go and check that one out that one has more detail on the daily and more importantly the weekly chart but right now a couple days have passed still some more consolidation I think overall this chart still looks pretty good to me I'm sorry I know a lot of people were starting to get bearish or concerned that we might drop at the moment the chart looks fine it's it's holding up well I think it's consolidating a couple of big candles that we saw early in the cycle up well above the Bollinger Bands now come back into the Bollinger Bands I think still consolidating so overall it's an early cycle count it is showing some very good strength overall the only negative I guess is that I do think we have a ceiling still in play with this kind of $6,000 or $58 to $6,000 area I do think that would be a ceiling but that still is more than 10% above our range right now so I do think there is time and there is certainly room price-wise for this cycle to fill in kind of this gap here all the way up to the $6,000 area now of course it doesn't have to test that $6,000 or $5,800 area in this cycle but just because we have broken out of this this multiple cycle zone here and now that we're in this let's call it no man's land where there really wasn't a whole lot of price discovery if you look back in November we only had one two three four five six seven eight eight trading days in this 42 to 5800 range which is $1,500 range that is not a lot there is no real significant support or resistance in this area right now so it can and probably will sort of fluctuate in this area I would think I don't think there's an immediate danger of it retracing all the way down if it does then it's probably going to be more something like this where it's just going to do more of a back test of this breakout and then come back up again one more time before coming back down to the cycle low this is kind of how I think it's going to play out right now of course no crystal ball but this is just I think we're in this extra zone here above above this tight trading range that we had but keeping in mind overall that we're still in we're still in kind of those crypt that crypto winter phase even though we're beginning to kind of come out of it a little bit we're still going to be we still should be kind of trapped in this below trapped in this below six thousand dollar range I think for some for some time to come and maybe even all the way out to to kind of the the later months of the year definitely into the fall autumn of this year I think we don't get up and above six thousand so that that being said I think we still continue to chop around we just need to pick our spots from a from a trading standpoint where we leverage up is going to be important because we don't again have a clear range or clear trend I should say although now for me where my bias back in January was for a downtrend bias for a bear market downtrend where I was holding my shorts longer more keen to get into shorts and if I was going long I was sort of keen to take profit early I'm no longer thinking that way I'm thinking I'm more biased now to the upside although I don't have a bear a bull market sort of trend bias on me at the moment but I do think that we are now in more of a an accumulation uptrend than we are anything else and for that reason I am more willing in my trades to let them ride a little longer move the profit targets out further take less profit I guess further up front and just give give trades in general a little more room to give me more more profit so that's kind of how I'm thinking and approaching the trading at the moment but you know I'm looking for a leverage trade on Bitcoin I don't see it right now because like I said before we could retrace back fairly easily and still be very bullish and could easily still go up and test that $5,800 area that doesn't give me a whole lot of room here to at least you know to get positioned behind any one of these sort of scenarios whether it's long or short so I prefer to just sit on my hands when it comes to Bitcoin for now and let something develop a little more clearly and cleanly for me to enter into I think where there is some opportunity is probably in Ethereum Ethereum did very little during this last kind of it's called Altcoin pump even though it wasn't anything significant it didn't do much at all but now it seems like when everything else has sort of settled down somewhat Ethereum is making a move now I'm looking at this more against the dollar at the moment and we definitely have an ascending triangle that has broken out I like this breakout so I've taken a long position versus the dollar looking at maybe getting a nice big move up to around about the $240 area but maybe even at least the $200 area which is it could be another 10-15% from here take some profit around there and then maybe let the other the other half ride up towards $220-$225. I like this chart a lot it looks pretty clean to me and it can and does support that's why my stops are fairly low at the moment it does support a potential move back to kind of this $162 area before making that move up that's also a possibility but I do like the the structure of this chart and the nature of this chart I've taken kind of the the longer or the widest portion of the triangle and applied that going forward up here and it kind of projects a $240 range when you look at Ethereum further out in the scale versus the dollar $240 really is peanuts even even kind of this area here where it broke down right in November is $222 this little peak here is $257 so getting back to this area doesn't do a whole lot it's not like it's going to be a ridiculously you know significant move or anything like that getting back into that zone if you zoom out is is pretty insignificant and not that surprising I guess if you look at the fact or if you believe the idea that December marked the four-year cycle low I think this looks like a decent setup to me so I'm long this for now let's just see how it goes my entry was a little late I actually got in a little earlier slightly but then then my alert was posted but still ideally the the right spot would have been probably more around the $170 $172 area once there was sort of three or four percent separation from the breakout point that would have been the ideal spot but I'm still comfortable because there is a decent amount of upside potential here so the rewards aspect of it is pretty good allowing me to just say okay I'm still going to take this trade and see where it takes me 156 right now is sorry 153 is below this candle right here 156 is right below this candle here so it is if I zoom in my stop right now is mirrored on this bottom of this candle right now right here so that gives the that gives the free the flexibility to come back and retest the breakout point and the breakout point is not exactly clear because there is a little bit of action over here but this candle here and sort of this candle here gives us some room anything below 156 probably is not of any interest anymore and at that point would be below the 10 and probably the 20 day moving average as well so that would be a point to get out so this is what I'm doing here with with ethereum and then I posted that I got out of the Monero Bitcoin trade just wasn't doing anything guys and I'm not afraid to close a position for a for a loss I prefer a partial loss than a full loss on the position but also it clears my mind I don't have to babysit it I don't have to watch it I don't have to let it sort of play on my mind here the fact that my initial thesis was the breakout of this triangle and it came back in gave a little time here to sort of get back and recover and then just languish for another four days since so for me that's that's a pattern that's no longer working so why be in a position at that point clean up your trades close them out who cares if it's a technically a loss on the scoreboard a smaller loss is better than a larger loss that's the way I see it capital first win loss ratio is kind of irrelevant when when when when really capital and capital in your balance capital in your account is really what's more important and then the other open traders Tron versus the dollar TRX broke slightly above the it's not really a breakout point necessarily but just using the the highest here back in January and February it has a nice structure this is the highest point you can draw you can even draw a kind of get some of these other peaks over here I think it has made a move higher it looks really good there's a very deep base so I took a long just based on that let's see how it goes gonna give it some some time here to develop and it does have a nice run over the last couple of weeks it is already up around 20 or 30 percent so it's not like it's early but I do love the base that we have here and I do like the fact that it has well a lot of significant room up to the upside first target would probably be around about I would say that you know maybe this up this area up here where these two candles are so more like the point zero three eight point zero three nine maybe even close to the four cent range as well so just keeping an eye on this for now just to see how it goes hopefully to move higher we can move up our stops closer and closer to break even as quick as possible but for now just just giving this a chance I talked about ADA in the past I still have a small long position around a third that I'm going to keep and wherever it goes it goes it's pulled back healthy pullback over the last seven days and maybe now it's sort of coming back up this is the original line that I drew so it's come back to this point let's see maybe it can go higher if it does go higher from here and maybe come up towards recent highs then I can really move up my stuff even more again but this last final third that I have is a patient position and that's the type of position I'm going to let ride and hopefully we can see Cardena come all the way up to sort of this 2400 and maybe even the 3000 level over the next month or two so that's more of a longer term let's just call it intermediate term play now that I've taken out a couple of good profit points from this trade let the rest ride and see what it can give us if it's a good if it's a bull market in play right now something like Cardeno could really do well I think going forward and this can be a significantly big winner but worst case it's going to close out for not so much of a loss so that's what I see here on Cardeno somebody made a special request for XRP XRP still continues doing the downtrend if anything if you look at the Bollinger Bands here we're starting to hug the bottom of the bands we ask continuously weak this is a very weak bearish chart in my opinion and I've been talking about this being in a downtrend for the longest time and it's pretty much been occurring look at this trend line that I had drawn many you know some time ago it was kind of hugging that trend line and now you see separation between that trend line as it moves to the downside and now it's definitely hugging the bottom of the Bollinger Bands here so it's pushing a couple you know it's pushing a standard deviation there still going lower looking weak I don't know where this goes but I can definitely see a maybe a double bottom with this October low maybe even below that there isn't much of a trend but the short term the more recent trend is definitely down so for me there isn't anything too uh too exciting about this trade about this about this coin at the moment at all and lastly let's look at total market cap again excluding bitcoin I like this chart this one I've I think I'm going to be focusing a lot more on when it comes to the altcoin space altcoins here this is just purely from a dollar perspective so it eliminates the bitcoin noise it eliminates the pricing in bitcoin and so total market cap all crypto excluding bitcoin doing really well broken out seems like we have a bottom in place we have a reversal and now we have a consolidation here uh could move slightly lower but then it looks like we have a new trend high at this point so I'm very encouraged by this I think this is very good news for the entire space good news for 2019 good news for potential bull market coming at the end of the year and next year overall looking uh looking promising okay my friends that is the midweek update I hope you enjoyed it as always any questions post them below my next update will be on friday which will be a pretty extensive covering of 30 plus coins the lightning round look forward to it until then be well happy trading watch the risk thank you", "source": "episode-2019-04-10"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-03-04?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members it's Bob Lucas it is Monday morning in New York I hope you're all doing really well and had a great weekend gonna cover the Bitcoin cycle today and quickly go over what we could be looking at in the altcoin space unfortunately I think the kind of the bearish presentation I made last week is playing out as I expected we did not get a little bump as I thought we might get but we definitely are moving lower at this point we seemed to have kind of we seem to be breaking down now from this consolidation period that looks a little bit like a bear flag my concern was that after a big decline like we had last week on the 24th of February that we would after a period of consolidation continue the trend lower it certainly looks that way at the moment unfortunately I think the next real opportunity for Bitcoin to rise is going to be in the second half of this cycle I talked about how a 60-day cycle has you know two sort of halves to it we are now on day 26 of the cycle so we are approaching that midpoint and it's pretty logical now looking at this chart that we do have a day 18 high in place at least for the first half of this cycle and that we're now moving down into that first half cycle low of this 60-day cycle so I don't know where that takes us looking at the chart and you can kind of ignore this this was this is leftover from my last video where I was showing the bear the bullish opportunity that still is an opportunity right now but I'm just going to erase that for the time being and pretty much look at this and say okay day 26 we have roughly four days to a midpoint so anywhere between kind of today and next eight days we can expect kind of a half cycle low I think that half cycle low does not break down below this cluster of of candles that we had from the early portion of the cycle I think that will act as too much support in any type of decline but that's not that far far below that's only around 200 below so it could get exceeded on an intraday basis but I think what we're going to see now is sort of this move lower a couple of days maybe four days let's just say for argument's sake the midpoint 30 days then I think we get our rally in the second half of the cycle now based on the structure of this the way it looks I don't think it can exceed in this 60 day cycle the two current highs that we have showing here for 2019 well that's that one's late 2018 but but in the last sort of two months right I don't think we can exceed that we could it's a possibility and that would set the scene for a possible or for a likely right translated cycle meaning that we exceed the high exceeds the midpoint which means the next low would probably stay above this low and that would be a good start for potentially some good accumulation and then some gradual improvement over 2019 but for now I think we have to stay defensive we do have you know a huge downtrend behind us we still have 14 months of of sort of bearish prices we don't have solid or clear evidence that we have a new sort of you know that the bear market has ended or the four-year cycles and so we do have to stay defensive there's no way about it and that's also why I've been saying the last week I don't want to trade this environment this is a chopping environment trading this environment is only going to lead to for the most part a series of smaller losses that are going to start to add up very quickly and that's why I've stayed away I've kept my balance sheet clean there was no rule opportunity as far as I'm concerned what I was looking for if we were going to be really bullish was after a couple of days here in consolidation to rally up take out this day 18 high make another high and that would put me in a very bullish mindset at the moment I'm definitely leading more bearish but I also don't want to short because it's still only on day 26 of the cycle I only want to short from day 40 and beyond that's when the cycle is most likely to collapse that's where being short it can be rewarding and the surprises would more likely come to the downside I think what we're looking for again is the half cycle low decline I think then we rally back up we get people excited we exceed most likely exceed this Feb 28 candle that's sticking up and that high is 38.97 so let's just say 3,900 I think we end up between 39 and sort of 42 somewhere in this vicinity somewhere around day 40 let's just say and so let's just draw that in and then I think we start to chop and I think we move sideways then it all depends on where does this want to go right does it want to make a new low for the February cycle low does it want to sort of chop and and find support kind of in this lower 34 to 3600 area like the last cycle did if that's the case and that would become a very wide base of accumulation that could for the next cycle beyond April really help out and really provide the basis for the next sustained move which hopefully at that point will come up into the fourth higher four thousand dollar range even the five thousand dollar range again there's still a lot of work that needs to be done here it's not constructive enough for me to to be bullish in any way and again we need to see how Bitcoin responds coming out of the half cycle low into the second half of the cycle okay but otherwise I think it's still a bearish overall sort of a bearish look we would hope that this February the sixth low holds in the coming cycle low something like that okay that would be that would be fine you know that's just like I said many times we are in that sort of crypto bear market winter period even though we may be in a new four year cycle we're still in that I'm just accumulating phase there's still a lot of selling pressure still a lot of projects that are bleeding a lot of crypto a lot of ethereum a lot of cash they need to be selling what coins they have the miners are sort of struggling a little bit they need to keep selling there's just still a lot of pressure coming out of the bear market at the moment and there's still a lot of selling pressure here to be absorbed and that's something I've been talking about since the December lows right don't expect a massive rally at any point until we absorb all of this action I did say back in December that April is probably the cycle low even if it's not going to be a new price low it's probably the cycle low where things can maybe start to really improve and we start to get some upside momentum and where we can probably start to break out of this kind of range here from the lows 3100 up to sort of 4200 this area here a couple of cycles would be enough to paint a you know paint paint the chart and and complete the sort of accumulation for this stage to get it up into this next sort of zone here so that's what I'm looking at the moment again the markets can always surprise right we can always rally up from here break this day 18 high form a high in the day 30s or 40 range and that just changes the perspective or the picture entirely but until I see that I have to respect what I'm seeing on the chart I have to expect the price action respect the price action and therefore I just can't be long or even short at this point but I'm in definitely you know sort of a wait and see patience mode at the moment I prefer to be sitting in cash so to speak and in this case being in sort of a stable coin for example for my trading account right from a long-term perspective definitely fully invested I like this zone I don't think we get much more of a discount in waiting of course we could always get lower prices briefly in in April but long-term holders you should be fully invested at this point and then I'm going to quickly just go look at Ethereum all the old coins don't look great there are some exceptions of course but in general like Ethereum as I as I alluded here last week it's breaking down that tells me that the alts are going to lead down as well tells me that we're not ready to rally overall all right the space had its move here it is here it was big it was healthy but it was short-lived right and I always said in a bear market or in a negative sort of environment the rallies are short and steep and then you get the sell-offs right so that's where a left translated cycle is all about you get the you get a good third of a cycle then you get two thirds in a declining phase so we just need to be patient we need to work through this period the the light is definitely at the end of the tunnel but we still need to be more patient there's still more work to be done here it's going to take a little bit more time Ethereum to the dollar exactly as I had hoped or as I as I had shown didn't even get that little pop that I thought we would it's just rolled over clearly here this is a top of some type it's the half cycle top no doubt do we go into the half cycle low here do we rally back up and then where does it go from there okay that's the question looking at the structure of the chart you know I think we we probably roll over again just like I said for Bitcoin roll over in this sort of area right over here and then come down and form the cycle low I do believe though that this December low for Ethereum is going to hold I believe that's going to be the bear market low but again right if price comes down and takes it out then I accept it and I move on that's just the nature of trading okay it's good to have an opinion but let's not get let's not get too hung up on these sort of predictions or opinions especially like something like that where it doesn't necessarily matter from a trading standpoint I took a look at some of the other ones as well they're all kind of similar Litecoin is still holding up still the strongest of them all this would be a good buy at the next cycle low in April just as it was a good buy here even though it surprised everybody pretty much and and maybe left a lot of people behind and not being able to take a position but I think as it comes down into the April low Litecoin is going to be one of those one of those alts that you probably want to be long into the new cycle for sure just based on the way it's it's strength over the last two cycles at the moment okay so that's the update for this week I'll come out with a midweek update on Wednesday in two days time I'm actually going to post a public post probably this afternoon something I did on YouTube on sort of huddling and having a strategy for the really long term I just I just edited edited out that video I'm going to publish that as a public post so please look out for that as well otherwise I hope you're all doing really well leave some comments in the section below and I'm sure to get back to you as soon as possible all the best", "source": "episode-2019-03-04"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-02-19?", "input": "", "output": "Hello Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas. it is Tuesday morning here in New York. I hope you're all doing really well. I have a very exciting video for you today. it's it's the first time in- in quite a few months in fact- that we do have some very positive action on the charts here and across the board. this time we are seeing strength, we are seeing volume, we are seeing some really nice and encouraging moves. it has been a long, 14 month grinding bear market. I don't know if that bear market has ended. I suspect, from a price perspective, that it may well be the low back in December. it's hard to say, but I think we are now well advanced in the bear market and we're now into that final kind of chopping motion or chopping range of a bear market before then building a base to start to begin to get out. and I think what we're seeing right now is an early cycle rally that, for the time being at least, should create a decent amount of fear of missing out amongst participants and should create a decent amount of upside momentum. I don't see this turning lower anytime soon. of course, always, risk management process dictates that we are prepared for a surprise against our position and against our you know analysis. but right here, I still believe we are only on day 13. so let's take this. this is from the other day. I believe we're on day 13 of a cycle. I believe we will exceed the day nine high set in the last cycle. so I do believe we'll exceed the 4200 area. I also believe that the market is really hungry for a rally here. so I believe we're going to see a move up to that day nine high probably form some good resistance at that point, fall back, maybe sharply, just to kind of shake out all these extra leverage longs here. people fomoing in right this at this level here between now and say, the 4200 area. but then I think we actually rally sharply and- and this is just, you know me talking out loud- looking at the tape, looking at the chart, but also looking at just just the fact that we're overdue for a good sizable rally bitcoin hasn't seen. the last cycle was decent. the cycle before that was almost non-existent. you really have to go back into august of last year, which is, you know, a long time ago already, to see any sizable rally, and even that, by bitcoin standards, wasn't anything special. so I just feel that bitcoin, even if we have bear market lows ahead of us in 2019. I just feel that it's really overdue a nice sizable rally and, of course, those sizable rallies really only come in the early portion of a 60-day cycle. we are in the early portion of a 60-day cycle. this, to me, is looking really positive. here. we had a nice surge, higher consolidation. now we're really starting to stretch out here and I believe we could easily see, like you saw here in the early cycle, uh, last cycle, I think we can easily see three or four big green bars all the way up into this sort of 45- 4800 area. you know, again, I don't want you going out and betting in ridiculous size and leverage purely because I'm thinking this could stretch another thousand dollars from here. my point is that we have momentum now behind this cycle. we are in a new cycle, so I think we just want to let it play out and see how much higher this market can really go at this point. so I'm long now. uh, bitcoin, as of the break of the january 19th high position, is in around about the 3790 area. I'm just going to let this ride. my stop right now is at the lows of these candles down here, though they are pretty far below at the moment. I'm looking to start to to right, you know, to increase that stop level. but I want to give this a little more room here. I want to give this a chance to even come back all the way back to the 10-day moving average, which at this point would be probably below my position, easily below my position entry. so give it some room at this point because it is early in the cycle. um, but anything below these candles here right there, would you know, would not be- uh, hang on, let me see if I can draw that in- would not be something I I think you'd see in an early cycle rally. so kind of that level there, anything below that point now would indicate to me that we have a very quick top and of course, a very quick top here without making a new high above the December 24th high would would be very bearish. there's just no doubt about that and it's a possibility in cycles and in any market, of course. but uh, it's a possibility that we do see a an early, an early cycle high that does not exceed. if that happens, you want to get out pretty quickly and that level here at the moment would be a, you know, would be a loss in the position, of course, but would protect your capital to the downside. because I just think anything below that point, anything below that line right now just would would not seem right from any cycle rally perspective. you want to build momentum in a cycle rally and you want to see higher lows and higher highs and that right now is already kind of a low. um, here's established low. so I can leave that blue mark in there, just as I had these blue marks. they represent recent lows in in the space. I could probably get rid of this now as well. so we've now exceeded a significant point here. next significant point would be this: generally the eighth high, around 4100. that's also very close to the 42: 30 area, this high. so these two here, probably from a block perspective, let's see if we can draw a rectangle in. I'm sorry for the noise, background noise. the building's heat is going on. let's see if we can draw in a rectangle if I can. what am I doing here? here we go, so something like this: right, that area here probably provides the next level of resistance for this cycle and then it'll bounce off that possibly a couple times and then move higher. um profit target? I really don't have a profit target at the moment. I think I'm gonna let this one play out. I have a feeling we we may again stretch higher, so I want to. I want to take advantage of it here. I want to move my stuff up as soon as I can, but I want to be able to make some really good capital if this market moves higher. I'm not going to be in such a huge rush to take profit because we are early in the cycle and I do like the way this cycle low ended, with it staying above the December 15th lows, the fact that it had an entire cycle, almost an entire cycle, except for the first nine days, but the fact that it had, um, what is that? 54 days of decline, sorry, 44 days of a decline without breaking below December 14th- that's bullish. so I want to give this some room and I can already see, as I'm recording this live, this is still moving. you know this is still moving well, so you want to get your position in. if you're not in already, hopefully you're in already. on this line I did. I did advertise the fact that if we did have an upside scenario back when I wasn't sure whether it's too high, one more low or one more high, I did mention that this would my, this would be my buy-in point. this would be my point where I was wrong on the downside and need to go to the upside. so we want to be able to flip quickly our bias and our perspective when the market dictates. so this is what I'm seeing right now. let it play out. I'm not the type of person that's going to sit there and watch this price on the minute by minute chart. I'm in now and I just let it ride. the more you watch and worry about how much profit you're earning on a trade, the more the opportunity you'll have that you'll close out quickly because you just can't handle the gains. so just don't do that. just watch it, let it play out. I'm going to go over a couple of other positions I have. I do have my XMR position still going, almost came back to this new stop point that I that I published, which was the break-even point. so now it's still showing a decent profit, giving this a chance. my profit target is still up in this, this area, here at the 10% area, which which equals the December 24th high. so I'll take 50% profit here and let the rest ride. at the moment, the worst case here is our break-even, so that's a good position to be in at a break-even point. if this can move higher then obviously I'll move the stop. but that's the first target for the Monero XMR position and then Bitcoin Cash. let's see if we can feel that I'm also in on this. I had a alert on the on the trend line. it broke the trend line. I got in. I like Bitcoin Cash from a price chart perspective only because I do. we do know that it does pump every now and then, and when it pumps it goes really hard, like it did here and also before the fork between ABC and the SV clients. it used to do this all the time. so I'm thinking, or hoping at least, that this, although it's not looking too great so far, today it's reversed back quite a bit, but I'm thinking that I'm hoping that this is going to just extend and extend, extend and then I'll look for a profit target much higher up. I do want to bring up my stop to break even fairly soon, but I want to give this a little more room at the moment before doing that. so at the moment, the the stop is still below, just right at these candle lows here, but I do want to bring this up to the trend line entry point fairly quickly. but again, I want to give this a little more room, because there is the possibility that you kind of get a quick pull down to to retest the breakout point and then and then it goes. that's also a possibility. so, leaving that as an open possibility at this point- and Ethereum, Ethereum looks great. look at this. this is really a. this is a bottom here and I think this is also a bear market bottom for Ethereum right now. um, we did see, I mean like Bitcoin did the same thing of two, but I'm not ready to call Bitcoin a bottom yet. but I think Ethereum is showing, and the altcoin space is showing, a lot of relative strength and relative outperformance to Bitcoin. so I think we also now have the makings here of a kind of inverse head and shoulders pattern. I think we're going to rally higher at this point- I don't know how much higher, but we know that Ethereum is capable of really moving when it needs to and this seems to be stretching here. so there's no reason why I just couldn't sort of keep going up at this point, at least until the early March period, when the Bitcoin cycle will most likely top, I would think for this cycle. so I think it could do something like that up to the 200 area. and if we look at previous points in the decline, then this here is a really big cluster. I would think. let's see if I can get a rectangle going, yeah, so uh, kind of this area. all right, that that's. there's a lot of a lot of activity there. I would. I would expect that here offers the top for the cycle here. so that's still a decent move from this point. it also is a new high, a higher high. so we will have a higher low in place and if we can exceed this 160 dollar area, we would have a higher high. so that's, that's the definition of a trend change. so that would also be great as well. so looking for that with Ethereum, this is against the dollar, of course, but I think against Bitcoin. it's going to show a similar outperformance as well. so here we have the December low, here we have a higher low. so this is not against the dollar, this is against Bitcoin. this is important because this here the fact that it stayed well above the Bitcoin low, whereas in prior declines it was well ahead of Bitcoin. so it was making further lows versus Bitcoin as Bitcoin was also making lows against the dollar. it's now reversed that action here and I think we have the bear market low for Ethereum and also a bear market low for many of the altcoins because of this very chart. this, to me, is telling me that we have a pretty significant low in place. it would take a long time to grind its way back up, but there is a lot of room left here before this can get anywhere near level seen in 2017.. So this is great. this is very encouraging to me. this is very positive. I'm not saying: go out and really buy altcoins, but we now want to start looking at some of these altcoin charts and look for opportunities, because we may have the momentum behind the chart to to get in with some some confidence. Litecoin is also showing the way here. Litecoin versus the dollar looks to be now certainly making a bottom, so this here looks very positive. I think we have the next big pivot area, which is around the 70 to 80 dollar area- sorry, 75 to 80 area. there's probably no reason why this could not quickly move up to the 75 dollar area in this very cycle, and that makes it almost a triple off the bottom. here and again, these type of assets that move, uh, in significant multiples to the underlying Bitcoin asset, so as on the way down, as it sort of you know, moved at a pace of four or five times the rate of Bitcoin. it's going to do the same thing on the way up, just as it did in 2016 and 17, as it also did in 2014 and 15. this, just this- is just moving at a much, much faster rate on the way up and on the way down. so if, if we do have a bottom here in Ethereum, altcoins and Litecoin and we also if we have positive action in Bitcoin, we should should not be surprised to see Litecoin really exceed and excel here over the next month. so this is something you want to be getting into. I do have some Litecoin coming from a long-term position. right now I don't have a trading position in it, but this is definitely a very positive, very positive development here on the chart. and then Litecoin to Bitcoin again, it's also- it's also- made its lows. this is a similar looking chart to Ethereum. this is doing well, starting to step up now. so we've got this rounded bottom pattern and now we're starting to take out levels seen on the way down. so this is something you want to be paying attention to and if you do like trading Litecoin, then you've got kind of the green light as far as I'm concerned to to start looking for opportunities. so, uh, that's, that's the wrap up for the main coins. let me just quickly browse through some of my charts and I'll I'll look at these on the fly. um, but this is Stellar, which I was not bullish on. this was making brand new lows, although you know, every, every dog has his day, they say as they say. so this one here right now it looks like it may have formed a low and this one should do well now. I think everything's going to do well. it looks like from an altcoin perspective versus Bitcoin, I think, because we have positive momentum. we have, you know, new volume coming into the space. it's the old coins that would do better in that environment. Bitcoin should go up, but everything should outperform it and I think this Stellar here- although Stellar wouldn't be my choice because it didn't- it didn't outperform on the way down- I think you're going to get a knee-jerk reaction more than you are going to get any significant. um, you know outperformance from Stellar, though it looks like other coins like Ethereum and Monero and Litecoin would do better than something like a Stellar. but again, there's still room here as well. the one that's not doing well is Bitcoin SV, Satoshi's vision. uh, it's not doing anything in fact. let's see if I can get a chart going here. here it is, although I do think this will pump eventually. I think every- you know everyone- will have their day. um, but at this point I'm just. I have a trend line here with an alert. I think if this, if this trend line, breaks with some volume and some size, then maybe there's going to be a move here. but it's also possible that there's just no interest in cash SV at this point as well. so I'm definitely staying away from this. I actually sold my forked SV coins. I have not sold my Bitcoin cash coins, but I have sold my SV coins. just don't believe in any of this project. I think it's a pure fraudster type scenario with Craig Wright, so I have no interest in holding any of these coins. um, BNB finance: this has been a phenomenal run. this may go again. this could be consolidating, but I just don't know. um, I don't like necessarily trading. I mean, I like positive charts like this. this is great trend, but it's also it's also been extended since December or November, in fact late November- so maybe this is kind of like time for something else to have a run and this could pull back a good pullback. I probably would be interested again, but at this point I'm just, uh, not really that interested in something like Binance, mana coin, so mana, uh, decentral, and I do have some of this. um, this looks like it's now broken out somewhat well, I wouldn't call it with size, but actually this isn't too bad of a chart, uh. so we had a sort of sort of a breakout here. looks like it came on a good volume, a good bar there. I should say it's come back, maybe to retest. so if this can make some, some moves higher at this point, get back over the 1000 satoshi level, then maybe this could be a buy with a stop above the low point of the recent candle. that's also a possibility. OMG broke out and has not done anything since. not sure if this is anything I would get excited about. I did have an alert on the breakout of the channel. I didn't buy it but um, it's. it's possible that this goes higher, but at this point you really want to see more uh, enthusiasm from from charts like this that break out. this doesn't seem like it had any. Qtum here is building a nice rectangle base. looks like kind of a head and shoulders bottom here starting to get some momentum. has a long way to go before I get excited at this point. you could in theory- again, these aren't clean patterns- you could in theory look to go long right now and then use kind of the stop right here at 500 satoshi, that's only a 10 decline so you can get a. you know a little bit of a position going risk around. you know 0.5 of 1 of capital on there's something like this, only because you have momentum across the board in the altcoin space and ethereum- it is early in the cycle. this that could bail you out at that point. so there's a. there's a chance here that this could maybe just do something like this over the next cycle, you know, and that in itself can provide, you know, a good three to three to one or four to one risk reward: entry at 550, exit at 500, profit target around about 700. so, um, you know, not nothing, not an amazing opportunity, but something here that looks like it could play out purely based on on what ethereum is doing, what the altcoin space is doing and the chart pattern as well. and then raven coin: nothing going on here. it's retraced the entire move since listing on binance um, nothing to get awfully excited about unless it starts to make some, make some some, some moves and show some momentum, some volume, and comes back to break this kind of trend line all the way back to 278 satoshi from over, well, over a thousand. that's a typical kind of pattern that we're seeing over and over again with these new coins at list. i think it needs a little more time before i get too excited on something like this. xmr- i think i already showed xrp here- is uh, kind of struggling and and i think if the altcoin space is doing well, this one might lag. it's been, there's been some some negative- i wouldn't call negative press, but the jpm jp morgan coin might be placing a little bit of um, might be placing a little bit of pressure on this coin here, because many kind of consider ripple the banker's coin and jp morgan comes out with their own coin. so this could be a topping pattern. it did hold off from breaking this, this sort of neckline that had developed based on these two, on this head and shoulders pattern. it held that. it's come up, but it's reversed that now i think if this breaks below, cleanly breaks one percent below this neckline, it's a short. at that point at least give it a go, you know. so this is something to watch out for. at the moment i'm not bullish on this. that's definitely something i can say looking at this chart. and then i'm going to end with zcash. zcash did break out of this wedge, looked really promising. i actually did draw last week when it was up at this point. i did draw in a retest of the breakout point and it did exactly that, actually even went much further than that and made new lows. so the fact that it made new lows kind of negates, um, the pattern of a breakout of a wedge and going off to new highs- or not new highs, but a new rally at least. however, it still is looking like it may rally from this point again. i just like other charts better than this one. i think there's a possibility that most of these charts actually go higher, but the question is which one is the better looking chart overall and and this one based on the level of a sell-off here? the fact that made new lows here on february 18th, which is already a new cycle for bitcoin, tells me that i don't want to be in something like zcash. it doesn't have the relative performance that i would look for to bail me out in in a room in a move higher. okay, i did say i'll end in zcash, but i'll actually end with 0x protocol or zrx token, and this is similar here. although i have this from a long-term hold. it's not performing well at all. it's not. it's not showing us anything to get excited about. we have new recent lows here as well. i want to be, if i'm trading at the moment, i want to be in the coins that made lows back in december and made a higher low here in february with bitcoin, and not ones that are showing more- uh, showing lows here more recently. that's just just not the type of coin i want to be in at this point. so that's the wrap up for today. encouraging news. i think we're looking good overall. we just want to see what bitcoin can do at this point. look for shakeouts, look for, look for some sharp moves, um back. you know, look it is. it is up 400 in five days, right, so a 200 pullback at any time is possible. um, don't leverage in with a size or position that you'll get shaken out of with a 200 move. you want to be um, you want to be positioned long, but not greedy long where you just can't control your position. again, as always, if you have any questions, please post them in the bottom here. i'm happy to answer them and again, i hope you're doing really well. have a great week and i'll have a video out in the next couple days. all the best.", "source": "episode-2019-02-19"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-02?", "input": "", "output": "Hello Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas, Tuesday morning. Special update today of course after a nearly 1000 point, actually more than, actually about $1,000 move in Bitcoin overnight. Huge, huge move. Really powerful, really surprising. Well, not surprising, but surprising to the extent that it went. And overall, just really exciting. Now, this does have many implications on the cycle and what we're looking at. But let's just put that aside for one second. Look at the bar that we have on the daily chart here. We had a couple of tests of this sort of area here. I personally did not expect it to break out right yet. I thought we'd get a pullback into a sort of mild cycle low here and then go out and then push higher. I did say if it went up, I would not necessarily trust that move and would want to wait for a pullback. Now, I don't have a long leverage position on this, but I do. Obviously, I'm not hedged. I have not shorted except for one attempt. And I essentially am denominated in Bitcoin. So overall, I'm still long Bitcoin, one to one to my coin. So I'm happy to see this, but I'm happy to see this for another reason. I think this almost all but confirms December as the four-year cycle low. And that's really important because then that starts to put into perspective the fact that we are indeed in an accumulation stage or phase of this early four-year cycle. So a new four-year cycle almost certainly now. And that means that we should start to see these cycles make higher highs. And we already see that, of course, here. This is not a higher high, but this is a higher low. And then it all depends on how we look at the current cycle. Now, this is where cycles can, in real time, not provide the most absolute detail that we need. And we have to accept that. And that's because right here, we have a couple of different alternatives, different scenario accounts that we're looking at. But in both cases, they are pretty bullish overall. It's telling us with this breakout that we now have higher highs, of course. And we have five-month highs to some extent, or four-month highs, I think it is. Four-month highs, an uptrend, you know, 30% or 40% off the bottom. This is all positive news. From a cycle standpoint, there's two things that could be going on right now. We either have a day one cycle low, sorry, day one cycle, meaning the cycle low is right here. Looks very odd. And this is the case that I talked about where you have a time-based cycle low. So all the selling was not able to push it down in the cycle low, too much buying, and then it rockets higher in the new cycle. Now, for this scenario to be my favorite one, I was expecting that to happen, and I called this out yesterday, I was expecting that to happen in around seven days and not so much right now, meaning that I wanted some more sort of time-based consolidation in this area, wait until the weekend, then do just exactly this. So the nature of this move tells me it's a time-based cycle low, because of the power of this move. I just wanted to see this happen kind of later in the week, a little further in the cycle. So that's the first scenario. Second scenario is that we still are on day 54 in the cycle, but we're making new highs very late in the cycle. And so what we may see now is a beginning of a pullback down into the traditional 60-day cycle count, but maybe only retest the breakout point or maybe slightly below that point just to shake a few more people out and then go higher. In this case, we're talking about sort of a day 60-ish give or take. Let me take that away. And then here's your cycle low there. In the traditional timing band, we know budget is higher in price. So those are your two scenarios. Both scenarios are bullish. Both scenarios show a higher low, no matter what, basically. And in one case, a higher high. But the second case, a higher high in the third cycle. So if this is a cycle low here, this was a cycle low for this small short cycle, which was not a higher high. But then this cycle high is already guaranteed to be a higher high because we have this bar on day one. So either way, very bullish. In terms of how to trade this right now, here's the hard part, right? Because you've got this massive move. Now we can easily see another 50% retrace. So it's really hard to be long here in a leverage standpoint when you've got this type of bar. And even if you zoom in, I think if you go to the one hour chart, you'll see that most of that happened here on one hour, within one hour, maybe even just sort of one and a half hours. So there's a lot of short covering right here. A lot of people who were either short or had positions to trigger a short were stopped out. So a lot of that could be reversed at some point today or tomorrow. So it's just hard. But then a lot of it might not, right? This could be just consolidating those gains and now it could move higher again. It's just hard to say. It really is from a trading standpoint. If you want to get leveraged, you know, it's hard to get that position. Now, obviously long-term I've been saying you want to have that position. You don't want to be messing around this late in a bear market. You want to be fully loaded. I think I even mentioned that in yesterday's video. And you know, if you're denominated in Bitcoin in your accounts, then you're still sitting fine, right? You're still exposed to the upside price in Bitcoin. The question is from a leverage standpoint, how do you trade that? Now, if we get a pullback towards this breakout area, that's an absolute buy at this point. You have to respect the strength of the chart, the strength that we're seeing in this market and buy a pullback at this point. But in terms of where it goes even further from here, I mean, if this is day one, then this is the problem, right? We could see, well, not really a problem. It's a good problem, but we could just see this. And I think that 6,000 area becomes resistance for the entire cycle. I do not see us exceeding that in this cycle. And then we do something like this, right? But how do you, how do you trade this right here from a leverage standpoint when really talking about risking one, reward is one, right? You're talking about a thousand dollar move up, a thousand dollar move down. very hard to take advantage of that now that the move has unfolded. So something to think about there. I'm not taking a leverage position at the moment, but again, no hedges, no shorts. That's crazy. This is a massively bullish and really exciting development here. I said, I think I even said yesterday, guys, the end of the light, the light, the end of the tunnel is really close. You've gone this far. Congratulations. Yes. We're going to have a couple more rocky periods. I think the fact that we did not double test or V shape a rocket out of this December low tells me that at some point, maybe over the summer, maybe if we bounce in this sort of 4,300 to 6,000 area, then maybe we get a nasty $1,500 decline, come back into the $3,000 range, maybe even test December lows. But I don't think we go below it. I just don't see how we do go below at this point. I think that's the low and that's exciting for me. Let's take a quick look at some of the open positions, see if they got smacked. This actually, if you think about, look at Cardano here, obviously taken, you know, sharply lower on the spike in Bitcoin, but these are matching, almost matching the gains in Bitcoin. So Bitcoin was up something like 20%. These alts versus the dollar are also up 15, 16%. This recovered beautifully. So I'm still along this stops all the way down here. We're not taking out, giving some room. This is good. I will look to see if I could move it maybe to that bottom of today's candle now at this point. But that looks good. I like this staying long. Qtm, same thing, got hit, didn't come near my stops. Now recovering, it seems like. I'll just leave this one again, see if I could maybe move this up in the coming hours or days or two. But for now, let it go. This, the altar performing really well, considering how strong Bitcoin is. This is good. Same thing from XMR, my position flushed all the way. Again, did not hit my stop. Come back up now. Now it's back above the breakout point. This looks good again. Even though you have this massive candle, that's excusable again because of the move in Bitcoin and the speed of that move. But the fact that this is recovered now and back above the breakout point is very positive to me. Keeping this position as well, keeping all my positions here. The one position I did lose, I noticed this morning, checking Binance. Here's my Litecoin position. This one here got flushed out, unfortunately. That's why you have stops. But this also, like the other coins, is recovering and may continue higher as well. I think this still looks good. Unfortunately, in a very fast market, when you're trading against, when the pair you're trading against or the other item in the pair is Bitcoin in this case, then you're going to get these types of wicks. So I got out right at the bottom here, right where it is now, actually, in fact. So that's three out of four. One got hit and then the rest will stay long at this point. So let's go back to Bitcoin here. Day one or day 54. So basically, either just still have to end the cycle or just starting a new cycle. Both cases are bullish because it puts in higher highs, higher lows across the board. I think that that almost confirms December low. Big positive news. Be patient, guys. You don't have to make every single trade here. I know Bitcoin's up sort of a thousand or maybe $800 right now. That's fine, right? We're long Bitcoin overall. We're exposed overall. This is really good news. Even your coins, if they're down somewhat today, they're still up against the dollar, the yen, the euro, whatever currency you are currently trading in or transacting in or getting paid in. It's up. The whole sector is up. So that's good news. And this, again, this is also a marathon. A lot of room. If we zoom out here, a lot of room to go. A lot of potential to get all the way back up. Over time, patience is going to be key. I know people are getting super excited on Twitter and everywhere else. Everyone's talking about how much money they've already made or they could make or will make. It's a process, right? So if you're a long-term holder, then this is just very, very positive news and the reason why we want it to be fully loaded. If you're a trader, then this is just another day, another move, right? Whether it's up or down, it's just another move. We'll have many, many, many of these types of moves coming in the future. And hopefully we'll be positioned for all of those to come. Thank you for the update. Of course, comments in the section below, I'll be checking throughout the day.", "source": "episode-2019-04-02"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-10?", "input": "", "output": "Hello Fintac members, it's Bob Lucas. It is around 3 p.m. Eastern time in New York, April the 10th. I hope you're doing well. This is your midweek update. Looking at gold first and well, another surprising move. A lot of strength here. Just don't not see why it has not broken down. A lot of support in this area here where we obviously expected the ICO decline to by this point have taken a firm hold on this market. Now the trend in the short term is still lower. We do have sort of a lower high here. The lows are holding up. They're holding up at the moment, creating some support here. So the question really becomes now what is this move all about? We certainly have a day 20 daily cycle low in play now. This has been marked. This is confirmed. We have four pretty strong days higher, back above the 10 and 20 day moving average. Just do not see how we are on sort of day 36 of a cycle that began back in March. So this is definitely another daily cycle. What's confusing about all this is that we have so many daily cycles now without anything remotely close to an investor cycle low. So we've got one, two, three, four, five, six, and this would be the seventh. I have never seen any cycles, any weekly cycles that have seven daily cycles going back over 20 years of cycle history or cycle data that I've that have collected. So I mean, it's always a first for everything, but from a week standpoint as well, we're already sort of into week 35, 36. So it's getting, getting kind of ridiculous here. I'm not too sure what to make of this, except for maybe the fact that we've just got a whole lot of buying support in this area. The market does not want to move lower. Um, and it's just, just holding up here. Well, right below zooming out here, kind of right below that continuous resistance area at around about 1360, where I think everybody is now really focusing on. So I, I, I, I, I can only interpret from, from this type of action and not seeing kind of a weekly cycle load down in this sort of low 1200 area that we may be consolidating here via time, putting in sort of a time-based ICL, maybe one more touch of of this downtrend line, come back, hit some support again. That's more than enough time in this period here for possibly shooting up higher. And then looking back in a month or two and saying, oh, wow, this was just some significant consolidation over time, not allowing gold and the market to really move lower. And that was the ICL of that, um, is something that I think we are going to be looking at when we, when we look back on gold in a few months. Um, of course that would all be negated if we do, in fact, you know, have, have that final push lower. I mean, I, I, I, I've been talking about it for so long. I, I'm almost so hesitant to say that it's due. It is due. Um, we do need to see ideally price lows to complete the cycle, but you know, I thought this one was going to do that. Then I thought this low, then I thought this cycle low, um, becomes a point where it's just becomes tiring to continuously call out daily cycle lows. Um, so something's going on here. Of course, I really can't explain it to, to that much detail. We need to let this play out, let it evolve over some time. And let's see if we do maybe get this time-based consolidation, form a final, um, kind of cycle low daily cycle low here that would mark kind of the end point of this consolidation zone. And then let's see if we can rock it higher from that point. And this is what I'm talking about on the weekly chart on the weekly chart. We're back now, right above the 10 week moving average, which we do see in a downtrend, uh, occasionally if it is just a sort of a wick above that, and then it closes below that point. So when you zoom out to the weekly, it's still not clear that we are just consolidating like I sort of, uh, theory, you know, the theory I have here, um, it could still well be just one of these very long process, um, type cycles where now we're hitting up against a 10 week moving average, and then it's just going to move lower from that point. Um, I don't know, maybe, maybe we just don't see a clear cut sort of week 24, 25 cycle low. Maybe we go all the way to kind of week 50 here. Maybe this becomes a long drawn out cycle and process from this point where I'm just going to draw something in kind of, kind of crudely here. All right. And we kind of just have this deeper cycle and then we move higher again. So, you know, when looking back at it, we'll have, um, almost like a week sort of 50, a week 40, week 50 cycle, but really it'd be two cycles in one where we just don't have a clear cut mid cycle point. Um, that would be my other explanation for what could be going on here. We did have something very long here as well. That was only 34 weeks. We're already at that point now. Um, again, ideally the cleanest path here is that whatever strength we're seeing right now gets reversed. It doesn't feel like it on the tape, to be honest with you, on the tape, it feels kind of, kind of strong. Uh, but ideally we just get this and we finish this off, um, by kind of like late May. And then we get on with making an attempt to get back above that 1360 level. Uh, ideally that's what I still want to see. Um, but it's just hard to tell. There's just no clear cut evidence, but at the moment it's obvious that we have a top and it's obvious that we're going to decline 10 weeks moving lower. So at some point, you know, we still have to acknowledge and realize that I think we still are on that declining phase. The question is, is it just going to consolidate via time before going up in a new cycle or is it going to give us finally this type of green line, uh, that we've been looking for? So that still, to me, I have to just based on history and based on how most cycles move, I still have to favor this type of idea. But again, just reiterating what I sort of pointed out on the daily cycle chart, we could still see kind of, you know, this chop and then that would be really bullish at that point. And then we're going to kind of have like a triangle sort of thing here. Um, you know, and then a continuation higher two alternatives there at the moment. I don't really don't see any, um, any need to be short at the moment. It's just too much strength. I got out of my short on this reversal. Don't do not see any need to be long unless we at least break going back to the daily kind of break above this trend line here, but also more importantly, break above the day 12 high. If we break above this and the whole, there's no way this line should give away if we're in an ICL decline, that's just too far up. Um, and it's obviously a very clear cut daily cycle high. So getting above that at this point is a trend changer. And then I would look, be looking for some surprise moves higher than trying to get long as soon as possible on that type of move. SMP still looks great. I mean, the chart is beautiful. It's been riding the upper Bollinger bands for the majority of the time, except for the daily cycle low, uh, still plenty of time in the cycle to make a push even enough time, ideally or theoretically to, to make a push to new all time highs. We're not that far at the moment, but we also have a good gap feel here from, um, the Monday prior, which also was the start of the new quarter. This could be filled. I would love to see this field over the next few days. I think I would want to definitely buy that dip and get long on a good feel, but even the move back to the 10 day moving average, I probably would want to get long again as well. And then, um, look to see if it can go longer can most likely use this bottom point here as a stop. Anything below that is, uh, is danger for this trend, but, uh, clearly this market still wants to go higher. Clearly it's, it's, it's making up, making a case here for making all time highs inside this investor cycle and possibly also inside this second daily cycle. And I just did not think that was possible when this move started back in December and January, I did, uh, did expect, and I did ride a lot of this move up, but didn't really think we'd get too much further beyond kind of 28, 10, 28, 20 level before kind of peeling over in the next investor cycle. And then possibly by the summer making that, that move up to test all time highs. Um, so I'm surprised by the strength, but we have to respect the trend, respect how much strength we're seeing in this market at the moment. And it's been able to shrug off bearish news, you know, inverted yield curves and, and, you know, bad manufacturing data. It's been able to do that consistently and continuously. And it, of course it helps that the fed is, uh, any opportunity, just scurrying that line between, you know, saying that they will, uh, you know, remain cautious, but at the same time they will do whatever they need to do to support this market. So, um, you know, I, I would just, there's no shorting this market at the moment, it's just crazy or suicide. I don't think a short opportunity even arises until later in the investor cycle, which is not until May at the earliest. And that would be the third daily cycle. So at this point, you're either just saying, okay, this is too rich for my blood, or I don't see a trade set up. Um, but there is no short here. There's only longs as far as I'm concerned. Crude oil continues to go higher. I missed my opportunity. I did really want to get long crude back in here. I waited too long for a pullback this now up to 64, $65, exceeding my targets that I had earlier in this daily cycle thinking and make it to 62, 63. Um, but this trend also looks as if it doesn't, uh, it doesn't want to end at the moment still, uh, this, this has quite slightly different dynamics than the S and P I do mark this as an earlier day 32. I think it is daily cycle as opposed to the S and P, which I mark right here, but they do have the same characteristics. So we're not, I'm not a hundred percent sure if, if we do not have a daily cycle here, uh, like this, if that's the case, then this is still relatively early in the cycle. And, um, you know, we do know that crude does love to move kind of in these extreme, extreme, extreme types of, uh, of moves when it does get going and it looks like it's now setting up for one of those types of moves. So in theory, this really could power up towards the 65, sorry, 68 and then even $70 area. I'm not sure on what timeframe, but if it continues this type of pace, it could easily get there within 10 to 12 trading days as well, the way this is going. So, uh, again, uh, I don't see where you pick a short, even though it may be a little overboard. Um, but you know, we crude in a trend like this can stay extremely overboard for a long period of time. Um, so that's what we have to worry about. And also the cut report that I looked at this past weekend, wasn't all that extreme. It was kind of at that middle level where, um, it had reversed it's, it's, it's other extreme side and now it's kind of just moving back towards another extreme, but has plenty of time before getting there. So, uh, providing some, uh, some of the, uh, what's called a tailwind for gold. And it looks like we may have a few more days lower before completing this cycle, uh, down to maybe sort of this area or maybe even lower. And then we, we have kind of that final, probably what's going to be the final day cycle, although gold, sorry, dollar day cycles do run fairly short and quick. They, they run in sort of two to three weeks. So we could still see another daily cycle after that. It's just hard to tell point is that we do have a very clear sort of pattern up and down. We're now topped. We're now moving lower. It's providing tailwind for gold. It will reverse at some point. And this may be, and I've been saying this for a while though, but this may be provides some of the headwind for gold down into a investor cycle low, especially if we get something a little more surprising all the way back up to that sort of point. Um, that may push gold down as well. Hard to say, I think overall the dollar still continues to consolidate sideways. We have more touches on the top level here and the lows are getting higher. So this is still a bullish chart overall. And, uh, we need to be careful watch this as gold traders and gold investors as well. Uh, so I do, I do like a long-term look at this and the way it's consolidated over time. Okay guys. So that's the midweek update for today. And for this week, I'll have a full weekend report as usual until then happy trading and all the best. So,", "source": "episode-2019-04-10"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-24?", "input": "", "output": "Hey good afternoon Fintap members it's Bob Lucas around 3 20 p.m eastern standard time in New York on the 24th about 40 minutes before the close looking at gold here had a good recovery today with a dollar up sharply so that's a an interesting development here at the moment uh yesterday we did see a good clean break of of somewhat of a flag pattern that developed over the past four days the uh the consolidation there was pretty much expected considering we had five pretty steep red candles before that and then leading yesterday to this breakdown i thought we would just continue going lower and lower and lower over the next five days it reversed yesterday formed a little bit of a hammer candle and today we're looking at a green candle it's come all the way up today to the what's the high almost um 12.79 so interesting here i i think well i'm still fairly comfortable or confident that we are still in this icl decline this to me is still not enough for an icl to form it's also fairly early in this daily cycle so pulling back here to me is still just a counter trend move in what should be a decline down to the icl more likely at the end of the month or early next month um we are now only touching the 10-day moving average so at this point i think a full close a daily candle close above or even come certainly comfortably above the 10-day moving average is a warning that we have bottomed for gold um now again the structure of this now that we are in decline tells me that we should have another leg lower if we measure kind of the daily cycle high at 13 10 down to this 12 70 area it's a 50 move this is consolidation of that 50 move another 50 move say from the middle gets us down to around about 12 25 12 30 areas so that's where i'm still targeting and looking for i think again like i said before any move back above 10 day certainly any move back above 20 day moving average is a sign that we probably have bottomed and i want to get out of my position so overall i'm still fairly short gold that gold position has not changed for me uh lowering my stops as we go down give it some room above kind of this 12 80 areas like a 12 84 for example 12 85 is more than enough at this point anything above that then it's no point in giving back a good part of the profit that you may have uh also when you look at uh let's take a look at dust for example so dust um pretty big candle yesterday took some profit uh half profit on the position um started off this morning very strongly has come all the way back down so that's a function of gdx let's look at gdx here so gdx is looking a little similar to gold so we did see the clean break so we now have the daily cycle decline and the break um came down below the bollinger bands and now has reversed kind of nicely today um so you know people are like oh that's it it's over my experience with the miners is that you know you're going to get many more uh you get a few of these counter trend moves and reactions and then continuous declines this is just not enough as far as i'm concerned and now especially since it has broken down i think it wants to keep going lower at this point i'm going to flip over to a weekly this is dust on the weekly gdx on the weekly so look we did break the 10 and 20 week moving averages which was expected we broke that channel that i've been talking about on the uh in the week in the weekly reports so we kind of broke this uh investor cycle channel that we had but we have not come down on huge volume just yet and we have not come down to test or touch the lower bollinger bands like i like to see on almost every icl decline every icl decline going back look at all those lows um typically will as as you see there typically we'll always hit the lower bollinger bands at some point we're nowhere near though at the moment so oops sorry about that um i think we still have a little more room to go uh seeing a one or two day balance is not expected because gdx is down around about 10 percent from the recent highs only a few weeks back another reason for taking some of the profit in dust it had a nice move higher i wanted to be able to sit a little more comfortably in a profitable position knowing that i took half of my position as profit so now a little more comfortable in riding the rest and potentially giving back if for example the miners have found and gold has found found the bottom and you know dust starts coming back down like this obviously at some point we'll get stopped i don't mind getting stopped at a at a rising stop level if or because we took half of the profit already at this point so that's another reason why i took some profit on that in that position switching to the s p now interesting day 32 today a little bit kind of like a spinning top there i think yesterday today was a slightly higher high so a swing a swing high could occur tomorrow this is 31 days to the current high which is around about what you expect we also potentially could expect a shorter cycle because we had a slightly longer cycle for daily cycle number one so i think now that we're just shy of all-time highs it's very possible that we do top for the daily cycle start to come lower and that's going to be something the bears are going to jump all over and talk about big double tops from the all-time high that we're very close to at the moment i know the nasdaq has made an all-time high so the russell is nowhere near but i think people are going to call this if it does form a daily cycle top they're going to call this a double top with the all-time high call for you know the bear market to decline to to take hold i don't see that i see this coming back down i see a nice little retracement and maybe not even as far as this down into the second daily cycle low and then a move higher to new all-time highs now i don't know or have too much of a strong opinion on where we go in the third daily cycle and where we go for this investor cycle and also where we go for the remainder of 2019 but i do think we're going to get all-time highs and i do think we're going to get those comfortably then we'll see if the market wants to create a trap a huge bull trap just above or maybe five three or five percent above all-time highs it is possible i just don't want to um i don't want to necessarily be strongly biased in any one way what i do know is that we have a pretty significant rally and trend in place since december and even zooming out all the way out we have seen periods of consolidation over a year or so that have led to higher moves uh the only thing about this one is that it's actually if you think about it goes back to all the way here so yeah it's a little it's a year and a half again as well um there's enough kind of feel in this area here let's see if i can kind of just rectangle that out there's enough in this area here if you look at prior moves to propel the market much higher so we had uh one sort of similar move in 15 probably even longer right maybe even as long as that so around about almost two years i think that one was which then led to this massive move and then of course we had the big uh one here in 2011. it's possible we have another one of these types of developments here consolidation over a year or more and if that's the case then we could look at possibly another four or five hundred point move in the s p if not if not more like a 600 point move a 20 rally at some point uh next the end of this year and then into next year as well just something to be aware of just thinking a little uh outside the box i guess a little more longer term for now though um i i don't want to be shorting or discounting this i think any short opportunity comes on the third daily cycle that's where you may be looking for a short i think if we get a good pullback certainly below the 20-day moving average i will buy uh leverage long a reversal below the 20-day moving average okay similar look for crude this um is now probably even gone beyond my expectations but what i've been saying the entire way you want to be long this or stay out of its way when crude oil gets in a it gets into this type of sort of mood like it did going down and now like it has going up it's sustained and it is pretty it's a pretty significant and extreme type of move um i think this could or should pull back as well i think the daily cycle is more likely to be aligned with the s p cycle currently i think i have it in my reports marked right here it's hard to say um there's a couple of different you know possibilities here but if it aligns with the equity cycle then we can look for kind of a top as well in this excuse me in this region and then look for a cycle low coming up something like this and then form the cycle low and then go again make another attempt at some pretty big move maybe even get a move above 70 or easily above 70 and then see what happens from that point all right all right to the dollar and what the hell is going on this is the strangest type of move we had a one two three fourth daily cycle expected to come down sort of test this area or somewhere at least to the bottom of this rising support line it has not done that it has rallied really sharply um it it questions the count on the weekly cycle as well but we are making deep investor cycle highs here but also more importantly we've taken out the last eight daily cycle highs and we are now at multi-year highs going back to 2017 so almost two years since the last high this can only be bullish except for of course a big bull trap but you know expecting and thinking and hoping for bull traps is a pretty much a loser's pro you know a loser's position to take because they don't occur most of the time the market goes with the prevailing trend prevailing trend since early 2018 from these lows is higher i gotta think that we are going to be moving higher out of this as well so on the weekly chart there's only one interpretation here and that we're on week 15 of the weekly cycle don't see any other icls right here this is a short cycle if it was only around about 11 weeks doesn't doesn't make any sense that that would be a cycle low as far as i'm concerned um so price now well and truly above the 10-week moving average made new hires exceeded the last investor cycle high we now have one two and wherever this high settles would be three consecutive low highs higher highs and we have a minimum of one two higher lows obviously the definition of a long-term cyclical uptrend gotta respect this as much as i don't like to see this from a from a goal perspective uh gotta respect what i'm seeing in this in this chart pattern here and if this is an ascending triangle that breaks then you've got pretty much a significant move maybe up to the 101 102 area as its potential the only thing the bulls will have to be concerned with is that like i said before the weekly cycle counts so we could uh be looking at a sort of final drive impulse not so much impulse but final drive in this investor cycle up to this point that gets everybody thinking we have a clean breakout come back down and form the icl and basically break the ascending chart a triangle pattern that's developed alternatively what we could be looking at in a more bullish case for the dollar and let me get a different color is that we continue to confirm the breakout come back down test the breakout point which is not uncommon in a breakout of a triangle pattern and then continue higher that would be a valid chart chart pattern i should say um as opposed to one that breaks down and forms an icl here so that would be somewhat of a shallow icl let's move this to there and that one is the blue okay that's the board i'm sorry but that one becomes the blue investor cycle low the green investor cycle sorry the the red investor cycle low chart would be down this area which would negate that and then in that case we would be looking for then a top also in the three-year cycle and then a move lower as well i know a lot of the kind of gold bugs dollar bears kind of or not kind of a really gung-ho on this type of pattern but they've been sort of going home on a breakdown for the longest time there was a big there was talk of a head and shoulders top right here for the longest time that didn't work then there was talk of a double top with this that has now not worked now people are talking about it and what i just what i just described here which is a sort of a false breakout or a bull trap then come back down and lower and i i i don't favor that opinion only because again the way this consult this has consolidated bullishly every time it tried to drop drop in daily cycles it continued higher and and found support and now it's sort of breaking out and higher as well so this is the the one sort of concerning part now you could also argue that back on the daily the last two candles have been extremely bullish and powerful and gold has actually moved higher so what's all that all about so there's something to possibly be said here maybe there's something more going on overall in the market with a dollar up and gold up but you know i find a couple of day correlations can exist where you don't expect them to and then the true or the expected correlation when this case being sort of a negative correlation comes through and then you start seeing more of that so that's what i think it will happen eventually so that's my update for this week hope you enjoyed it i'll have a full weekend report out on sunday take care and all the best", "source": "episode-2019-04-24"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-03-20?", "input": "", "output": "Hey good afternoon Fintac members it's Bob Lucas Wednesday afternoon around 6 p.m here in New York Eastern Time hope you're doing really well so we had kind of a roller coaster day I guess not unusual for a Fed monthly or not monthly bimonthly FOMC meeting this one was a little bit of a surprise I guess in that the Fed came out and pretty much said that they're going to counsel the rate hikes for 2019 they've lowered GDP forecast which means they want to be more dovish of course and an end to the balance sheet runoff so that overall is as pretty much as dovish and as bullish as you're ever going to get it's it's also a clear indication that the Fed is pretty much 100% behind behind you know getting aggressive and being aggressive and being more responsive I think more in real time as opposed to other Fed chairs who are probably more lagging data driven and I think that may just be the style of the current you know Fed chairman Powell and how he works or could be politically influenced to some extent and also just a sign of the times and how we're moving into more real time and more real time data and analytics point is that the Fed here seems to be adaptive and he seems to indicate that you know if this market continues to fall or obviously the economy weakens even slightly that he's going to be going to be pushing some dovish type policies to help rebound quickly so that obviously pushed gold higher today it pushed gold higher significantly from what looked like at one point and I was looking at the four hour chart it was looked like it was breaking down at one point today here it is here uh before that bar so it broke down below kind of this trend line uh it's only a four hour trend line of course over the current cycle but it looked like it was really breaking down it was down to 12.98 at one point and then of course the the Fed announcement came out and rallied as high as 13.17 just about um the Fed announcement and then of course the Fed announcement came out and then of course the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement!!

{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-03-28?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Fintech members it's Bob Lucas Thursday morning in New York around about 7 30 in the morning I hope you're doing really well this is your midweek update going to be a quick update here on the cycles let's look at the S&P to begin with so we obviously have a top in the cycle right now this looks like the top for the second daily cycle there is an interpretation perhaps that this here is daily cycle number one around day 50 or so kind of deep for my liking we have seen we have seen the S&P make shorter cycles more often than longer cycles which is the reason why I side with the day 31 interpretation both of these are obviously either too short somewhat somewhat too short or somewhat too long for a cycle low ideally the cycle low would be in the middle here it's not the other reason why the day 51 cycle could could perhaps be it is that we have a nice correction down or a nice decline down into this area here if I turn on the Bollinger Bands you'll see that it came all the way back down as opposed to this one here which would looks like more of a blimp than anything else in that case it would make this little cluster here the half cycle low this would be the daily cycle low it's really hard to say I don't think it matters a whole lot in the end because the half cycle low and the full cycle low kind of act in similar ways and the reason why I also bring this up is if this here is the cycle low then we're looking at the next cycle low coming up this makes it early day 30s day 32 for example drop below 10 day moving average an attempt to get back above the 10 day moving average that failed now hanging on to the 10 day moving average which in theory should then drop down and make a move to at least the half cycle low point right here or slightly below us maybe slightly above that would be the target now if this is the cycle low right here then we're only on around about day 13 this this drop should be a little more shallower that would be the half cycle low coming up into this area obviously if this is the full cycle low then we do not want to drop below that that would be a cycle failure that would be a top for the entire investor cycle almost certainly and that's not what we want to see so a couple of different interpretations here I think the overall takeaway however is that we're still in an uptrend still looking um still looking for higher prices I guess unless we see a little firmer evidence that we you know that we are topping now if if this is the cycle low right here this is the half cycle low if we do get a decline down below the half cycle low point that's also pretty bearish it's not indicative of a top on the investor cycle but it still is somewhat bearish as well so I think bulls certainly want to hold this area right in here above the the low here at 27.22 that's a pretty far drop anyway that's an 80 point drop I think if we dropped 80 points at this point and below that is pretty much telling us that we could be looking at a top at the weekly cycle level as well I think in this area right here I dropped around about 27.50 27.55 on the S&P index would set us up for looking at a long trade potential I would be looking for a swing low in this area if we can get that over the next sort of three to five days that puts this count at around about the day 40 mark so everything would be pretty well aligned at that point if we get sort of a drop in this sort of zone here um I wasn't drawing that really well I wanted the rectangle um let's see if I can get that back so here's the rectangle yeah so kind of in this zone here uh over the next let's just say you know five to ten trading days or three to ten trading days get a little drop into this area and then a swing and a reversal higher that would be a buy for sure all right gold took a trade this morning um got in probably could have gotten in a little earlier I wasn't uh wasn't really around yesterday to be honest with you in the afternoon although I would have gone I would have gotten in on the cross of the uh 10-day moving average so I'm a little late to this entry here uh hopefully it doesn't hurt me in the end but I think this is clearly a top the only problem that we have is that if this is for some reason right it doesn't look it but if this is the investor cycle low um and this is a first daily cycle low then we're going to be looking at um kind of a half cycle drop probably only to around about the 12.90 area and then a strong move higher I still want to favor what I've been covering in my reports which is that you know this is just a very long extended cycle and we still need to see an an investor cycle low drop in that case this uh this cycle low here or at least worst case this cycle low right here which is a clear cycle low um needs to be exceeded we need to sort of get down into kind of this area here probably bounce off this longer term kind of rising trend line that's around the 12.60 area plenty of room lower wouldn't cause a whole lot of technical damage if any and I think that would be maybe enough of a sentiment resetter to get the you know to get gold kind of going back up like this as well hard to say because again this has been acting uh very strangely with a lot of strength so I do want to be mindful of being sort of caught short again so my stop right now is at the open of this second candle or yesterday day before's candle I should say right around the 13.16 area I am keen to get this down as quick as possible there is a decent amount of gap right now between my entry and the stop here but I need to give it that much room just in case it comes back up before dropping down but again like I said I want to bring this down probably to at least the top of the wick of yesterday's candle 13.12 I want to get that to that point quickly and then maybe even to the open around about what is that 13.09 or so and then of course if it keeps dropping then we want to bring that stop down as quick as possible um let's take a yeah just taking a look at some of the the juniors and some of the miners in general I mean I've never seen an investor cycle low in the miners that looks anything like this so again this could just be telling us that there's a huge amount of strength here it's just going to surprise us kind of similar to the 2016 early 2016 mini bull market that we had in the the miners and gold where it just it didn't let you get in unless you were in and you managed to ride that it just it just you know you just stayed that that position it could be something like that um hard to say it looks like we have a big double bottom here but I do want to see at least some type of drop and this is not enough for me here even though it's sort of 10 10 for the miners is really nothing at all uh and look at the uh the seniors here the seniors are just showing a lot of strength this decline here uh last week or two weeks ago is just nothing on the on the chart here so you know I just would love to see some type of sort of punishment here get us back down into this area here and then you can go this is one of the reasons also why I still think the icl for gold is still ahead of us but again I will respect any price that we see in gold any strength and try and get out of the way and if we do see a reversal in gold then I would probably jump back on and go long for sure for example getting back up and above this 13 20 area right here is extremely bullish and I would want to get long because at that point we would have at least a day 13 15 I'm going to be sure what the count is maybe day 18 high and that's a first daily cycle for sure and I want to be in part of that I don't want to even though it may come back into a dcl I'd want to be long because you just don't know what type of surprise and the upside you get from that point taking a quick look at crude as well so crude looks a little bit like the equities came out of this half cycle low congestion or consolidation area popped up a decent amount got to the 60 target that I that I had in mind for crude looking at maybe even 62 it has not happened has sort of double topped to some extent now below the 10 day moving average I think this is going to come back and sort of test I didn't want to do that sort of test you know maybe this sort of 57 dollar area for the dcl but there's still you know crude moves you know in pretty extreme sort of fashion so there is room all the way kind of down to the 55 area and even below I mean this this cycle low is all the way 51 so anywhere in this area or this range is sort of fair game for crude as low as maybe even 50 sort of 350 350 that's a I mean I don't think it gets that low but it's a potential just got to be aware of that as a cycle low and then it can rally back up who knows after that it all depends on where we want to go in general with the equity markets and risk on in terms of how much further it can go in the next cycle and then let's finish with the dollar dollar's doing the same thing whipsaw up down up down up down slight cycle failure here telling me that this move now will not make a new high this is a reason why gold could really get get some momentum but the question is how much more does this go I mean it could rally up come back down and then go up again and then start to form the icl it's still not that not that advanced in the weekly cycle we have an icl right here in january so we do have potentially a couple of months even to may or even june before we can expect sort of a larger this sort of decline I think there is room let me just redraw this here let's get the tool out there is room for something like kind of like this dcl right here and then kind of come down into the icl numerous ways this can play to be honest with you even though we have a slight failure here that came on some some significant sort of I think it was jobs data or some some type of news that pushed it down and it rallied back up so don't necessarily put a huge amount of you know of weight behind this being a dc a daily cycle failure we still are in my opinion up in an uptrend even though you know again there was a sort of a slight failure right here in general though the trend is slightly higher on the on the lows certainly higher on the highs so um still a little bullish overall on the dollar here even though there is signs that we could be topping and then longer term of course this is still an uptrend and this looks like an ascending triangle to me which would be a continuation pattern in an uptrend so a lot of reasons to be sort of cautious here and um cautious that in a sense that don't expect a decline or a massive decline if you're long if you're long gold or want to be long gold for example the dollar still is still king in my opinion so I'm just I'm just really playing it both ways you know having an open mind and where it can go all right so that's the update midweek update I'll have a report out during the weekend of course on Sunday wishing you all the best take care", "source": "episode-2019-03-28"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-04?", "input": "", "output": "Hey good morning Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas. Thursday morning in New York, that's April the 4th. Hope you're doing really well. So let's do a quick update today on where we think the cycle stands for Bitcoin and take a look at some other coins. Don't forget tomorrow on Friday is the typical lightning round report where I go over 30 or so different coins and give you my viewpoint on that. So please leave some notes below if you want me to review anything specifically. But looking at Bitcoin here, look the only thing I can say with certainty is that we have a very positive development on the daily chart. This surge higher to break the prior confirmed cycle high or to break this at least half cycle high point is significant and cannot be discounted. This to me points to with almost, I never say with certainty, but with a very high degree of confidence that the bear market of 2018-19 is over with this December low. And of course, and I've talked about this in previous videos, coming back and doing a retest of those lows at some point in the future, probably up until August is a possibility and something we need to be aware of. But for now, the good news is that we have a very clear series of higher highs and now what's going to be higher lows. And higher highs and higher lows is essentially the definition of an uptrend or a new trend. So we have this reversal in trend after 16, 15, 16 months of pretty bearish declines here. This is very positive and to me indicates the start of the new four year cycle, a cycle that over four years, probably for three of those years will build up and build up and eventually explode again in another blow off top at some point in 2021. That's the exciting part, but we still have a lot of ground and a lot of room to cover. And I caution everybody, this is where I want to caution everybody, because a lot of people got very excited with this $1,000 move and so you should, but a lot of people did not catch any of this move except for the positions that they have, of course long, right? But from a leverage standpoint, very few are able to capture, hold and exit such a move. And I'm seeing a lot of questions. I'm seeing a lot of chatter on Twitter and other places where I think people are kind of like maybe even annoyed or envious that other people seem to have made a lot of money on this or captured the gains. And that can assure you almost nobody really did, at least not for the full extent. And then people now are talking about a continuation higher all the way up to sort of 6,000. I'm even hearing seven, 8,000 already. I mean, come on guys, we just get out of a bear market low just a month or two ago. People were shattered and complaining about how nothing was really working. And three bars, three days, everybody's already talking about seven, eight, 9,000. That's not going to happen. Not that short and not that quick. Now we could see another surge up to the $6,000 area. $6,000 area for zoom out is the, what should be now a significant resistance because it marked five, well, nearly five cycle lows an entire 2018 of hitting it and hitting it and hitting it, trying to get below. And eventually, of course it did, but that's going to act now as a lot of resistance. So if we get up there, it's going to get reversed in my opinion, but I'm not even sure if it does get up there in the next few days. I mean, it's obviously a tall ask. The uptrend that we saw is still intact. So we have kind of this really powerful speculative move still in play. We are sitting above the Bollinger Bands on the daily. So we could easily come back in before going higher again. We can spend five or seven days consolidating in a flag type pattern as well. And then going again for another 500 to $1,000 to a top, a short-term top. There are multiple scenarios here. I think the takeaway for most people, even experienced traders, is that we're in this sort of no man's land. Look at this candle from yesterday. It went as high as 53.50 and then dropped as low as 4,800. So that's a $500 move in the space of a day. Let's see if I can just zoom in on a two hour candle. Okay. So there it is. In the space of two hours, we've gone to 53.50 down to 8,400. And this is at the point where everybody started talking about, you know, on Twitter about 6,000, 7,000. I bet a lot of people are afraid of missing out, right? So that the classic FOMO got into leverage positions here and then was stopped out on this big move lower. And then what happened is, so you've got a situation where people didn't make extra profit, I guess. I mean, obviously their Bitcoin went up in value with this move, but they missed this and then lost money on the decline. And the net result is that we're still up a thousand dollars and they've lost money. I mean, that shouldn't happen. That's just that if that's happened to you, and I think it's happened to a lot of people, even if it's a small trade, just be aware of that. Make that a lesson for you to learn for the future is that you don't trade on emotions. You trade on setups and you execute on setups and then you execute out on profit on something that you've predefined. If you miss this big move, it's not a problem. It's not a big deal, right? If you're investing for the long term, that's great. You're already in, you're allocated, that's a very good development. If you're a trader, then this is just one setup of many. Okay? This is a 10% move, big deal. We had a 40%, 50% profit in ADA. Okay? So those opportunities will come daily and weekly and daily and weekly throughout the next year or two. So this is just a trade. And if you're really panicking or just concerned or envious that you missed out on such a move and you're sort of kicking yourself, don't. It's just another trade, right? And especially, again, like I said, if your trading accounts are denominated in BTC, some are trading with sort of the stable coins. But if you're BTC, there's even more reason not to worry because you still had exposure at a one-to-one level to Bitcoin and what happened here. So just be aware of that. That's a very important lesson as a trader for you to learn. Not only as an active trader, but somebody who's a passive kind of trader who's actively trading on a slower timeframe, maybe on a weekly sort of basis. A lot of them kind of just added in right here. They had all this time here, all this time to add to more positions, but now they've taken another position, a thousand dollars later. Okay. Because they wanted it supposedly a thousand dollars lower. Now they're paying the price. So you got to be more diligent. You got to be more thoughtful in what it is you want to do, what timeframes you want to be trading on and how you want to execute trades going forward. Okay. Let's get going. This was not a scheduled report today. Normally I do a Wednesday report. Let's quickly cover what I see on the cycle. So here, this is a case of rear vision mirror cycle work. Cycles are a reflection of price. They're not a something I front run with. At the moment we have a little bit of, let's call it lack of clarity on where the cycle may be. This here to me indicates that we are now starting sort of a bullish trend. What I mean by that is we don't have a clear cycle low. We have in the timing band, a consolidation in price and then a surge out of it. And whenever we get huge surges out of consolidations late in the cycle, I tend to mark the bar before the increase as the cycle low and call this a time-based cycle low. Now go back to my Friday video, I think it was, or actually Monday's video. I talked about time-based cycle low. I talked about the fact that this could be coming, this could be leading to a surge like this based on a time-based cycle low. The only thing I did say that didn't happen was the fact that if we were looking for a time-based cycle low, I was looking for that to happen more like this weekend coming. So into sort of the weekend and then a move higher, if that was the case. That didn't happen. Instead, we had a surge on day 55, which was slightly in the timing band. So right now it's a wait and see. We may have to remark this somewhat as we see price develop. And for example, let me just move this out. If we get an immediate pullback from this point, so we get something like, something like this now, okay, and form a low right around the initial breakout point. And then we start to go higher again. Then this gets remarked for sure. And then this means we had just a very late cycle surge, very bullish still, because then this is no longer the cycle high. This becomes the cycle high, day 56 high. This becomes like a day 65 low, for example. And then we push this out. Okay, nice and neat. We just have to wait and see how the market gives us. If though, we continue for many more days, kind of chopping around and moving higher at this point, and then come down later on, that's a new cycle. Okay, that to me means here's this, that remains the cycle low. This is a new cycle. This is the higher of the new cycle. And then we're looking for a cycle low at some point sort of in June. Okay, I think from here on, we're going to probably and don't hold me to this, because again, this we're in no man's land right here. And we're still technically kind of in this crypto winter phase. It takes if you look at prior four year cycle beginnings, it takes around six months or so to kind of get out of that basement level in prices. And they're considered this kind of the basement, where in between sort of the lows at 3000 3100 to 6000, we're gonna I think we're gonna chop in that area for a very long time. So just be aware of that. So I think price here in the next cycle can chop around, come back down. And then it's not maybe until August, that we kind of get a sort of a weakness in the market again, and a real test down to levels seen in February, maybe even December, it's hard to say. But I think it'd be very unlikely if this here is the lowest you get, since the lows of a bear market, and you just keep going higher. Typically, there's always at least one very significant test, retest, shake out, call it what you want bear trap. But you typically will get something really scary coming back. And looking at this chart 1000 to 2000 move back down at some point is what I would consider scary. Okay, let's go over a quick couple of positions that I'm opening, give you an idea. ADA, for example, closed out the second, third for really significant profit around about 60% on $1800 push, push as high as 1940, that's really good. I'm holding my final third now as more of a long term position. But I do have a stop right here below this candle. And this candle is associated with a Bitcoin surge that we saw yesterday or the day before. So around about 1450. Here it is right below give it some room. 1450 is my stop on this. That's well above my entry point. I've already got two thirds of my position cashed and banked for a good profit. And the reason why I want to hold this is that if alts continue to experience a major move and a major run, I as I pointed out here a month ago when I drew this this trend line in, we have the opportunity here to go as high as 2300 and then maybe even sort of higher 2800 and above. Obviously, it would take a lot of time to get there. But I want some exposure. I have a really strong hand in this now with my position. I've made some good profit. So it's easy for me to hold should be easy for you to hold as well. If you took the same trade, the rest of it's beautiful, beautifully profitable. And the worst case is if this reverses and this fizzles fizzles out that even the final third position will still make a profit. So that's how I'm trading this going forward. I'm not going to cover it too much now going forward. Just know that I'm keeping my third position for the for kind of the long haul going forward. XMR is another position I have open here. It's reversed all the way back was looking so solid. And now it's come all the way back. Let's see what happens here. Not not haven't got much room left here before being stopped out. Gonna give it a chance to get back up and out of the out of the triangle pattern here. XMR versus the reason why I'm only holding right now is XMR versus the dollar still looks really good. So XMR is doing really well. Bitcoin has just just outperformed essentially. So I want to give this a little bit of an opportunity. If Bitcoin kind of stabilizes or drops a little bit, maybe this will have another run higher and get back up as well. But this one now is below my entry point and just you know, it's on a watch list for getting stopped out. I won't let it go below kind of this level here. Kind of the breakout point that occurred last week. Okay guys, and then lastly, I posted a public video on the site here. I will put a link into that video in the comments below. But essentially I went over the four year cycle and the opportunity ahead. This is very good for investors, very good for all of us to kind of keep in mind where the potential prize is out a couple of years, something we really want to be focused on investing towards and mindful of. So take a look at that video. I think you'll enjoy it. It's around about a 40 minute video posted for free on the blog here. Thanks very much. Any comments below and tomorrow is the lightning report. All the best.", "source": "episode-2019-04-04"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-03-08?", "input": "", "output": "Well, good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Friday morning in New York. I hope you're all doing really well. Have a very exciting lightning report to give you today. I think it's going to be a long video. Just be warned. Although I will mark down all the coins I'm reviewing in the comment section below with a timestamp for you to be able to kind of breeze through it and go to the coins that you're most interested in. I will, of course, as always start with a Bitcoin wrap up and look at the cycle for Bitcoin, where we're heading perhaps. Then I'll get into each of the coins. Just a bit of a caveat or a bit of a disclaimer. You know my bread and butter trading is cycles. My bread and butter is kind of Bitcoin and the major altcoins because that's where the cycle really, you know, obviously the cycle was with Bitcoin. So that's what I'm trading primarily in terms of size, in my positions and my leverage. The altcoins are me just looking at a chart. Some of these today that I'm going to look at, I'm looking at them for the first time. Be aware of that. I'm going to give, in some cases, a five second nothing here or I'm going to give some analysis on the fly, okay, for the very first time. So just take that with a grain of salt in some respects because, you know, I'm just giving you my passing view on this. I may not, you know, may not be trading that. I'm just going to give you just a quick view of what I think. Okay, so that said, let's get into it. Start with Bitcoin. All right, so Bitcoin here actually is not looking so bad. Day 18 high. I think we have, well, comfortably have a cycle, a mid or half cycle low that occurred three days ago. And it seems like here that we're looking to sort of rally from this point, maybe go up. Now here's the big question mark. And I mentioned this in the last couple of videos. The question is, where does the top for this cycle form? If it formed right here on day 18, then that's not necessarily a good sign, right? It's left translated. It occurs left of the midpoint, does not exceed the prior cycle, does not create this higher high scenario that we're looking for. And then what that would mean is we'll probably get something more like this occur. And if that occurs, there's plenty of time left in the cycle. Another 30 days, in fact, because we're on day 30 of 60 day cycle. There's plenty of time, a whole month at this point for Bitcoin to really get in trouble, right? And the prior lows, the prior cycle lows, the last two, are not that far below. I mean, the February low is only $500 below and $600 to $700 for the actual bear market low. You know, Bitcoin can take, look at this candle here and this candle here and these candles, right? Bitcoin can drop four to $500 in a 24 hour period. So there would be concern if we do not exceed the day 18 high because we get this scenario and then there's plenty of time to do all sorts of sort of crazy things with Bitcoin. And that would be my concern, right? There's room below and time for this to cause damage and for this December low to finally give way. Now, if we, that's the bearish case. If we can though rally from this point and it's looking kind of positive the way, the way this chart's forming are now, if we can kind of rally at this point and get up and exceed the day 18 high, then we have a right translated cycle. We have a higher high. So this, this day 18, sorry, arrow goes away, right? It's an irrelevant number at that point from a cycle standpoint or mostly irrelevant, irrelevant, irrelevant, relative. Jeez. Um, the day nine high from the last cycle was exceeded. And then we have that high. So we have the higher low and a higher high and the makings of a new uptrend, right? So then we can probably do something like this, right? Big shake out into the April cycle low. But at that point, what, what do we have? Let's zoom out. So if we have this red bullish scenario, we're a right translated cycle. Let's just draw in red day 30 today. So let's just draw this in here. Okay. Let's have midpoint right there. Uh, this becomes the cycle high at that point. This becomes like a, you know, like a day 47 or something like that. Just throwing a number out there that becomes a right translated cycle. So the midpoint, the last low to this low, the, the high comes well past the midpoint. Uh, we get rid of this and then we have a situation where we have one higher low, two higher high, three, again, using the word, perhaps a higher low. That's the trend change that puts this December low into focus for being the bear market low, the four year cycle. So then what this allows for going forward is this trend change, this new uptrend and start to build and extend this base that we have. So we can rally from this point, uh, start to rally up, and then we can even go up to match the $6,000 area, which was the base of that descending triangle from all of 2018. That would provide a lot of resistance, but we can then make a move over the spring months, test that area, come back down and then, you know, sort of form that next cycle low in June, but at a much higher place and, you know, probably somewhere definitely above this first cycle high that we had. Let's just draw that out like that. So that 4,200 area, the two sort of peaks here would become support, but maybe even above this line as well. So that's also a possibility where we do something like this. Okay. Let's just draw that across and then this cycle low form something like that. Okay. So you're starting to see now this step up, step up, step up process where Bitcoin is forming higher highs and higher lows. And then, you know, that could probably bounce up for maybe even six months at this point up against a $6,000 level, which was that huge, um, you know, huge support before it, it was given, you know, before it gave way back in 2018, that's going to provide some resistance, but still point is that we get out of the kind of the gutter that we're in right here, the base and come up and step up to the next big level. But again, a lot of this also depends on what happens in the next five or 10 days. If we don't exceed this day nine candle, we don't have that new series of higher highs. And that puts, you know, puts this base, this bear market base in jeopardy, this sideways chopping motion. And actually I've been talking about, we do need to, at some point prove that we can step up and make a new higher high. So I'm looking at that really close at the moment. Uh, I'm encouraged, uh, you know, I'm long right now with a very tight stop, um, looking for a move at least back to just, just for the half cycle, at least back to sort of 41 50. But I think we can also break out a little bit and get up, maybe even up to sort of 45, 46 possibility. Okay. Um, let the market play out at this point. Okay. So now we're going to go into the lightning round. They are going to be, they're going to be alphabetically because my list is sorted right now. Alphabetically. I'm just going to go through, start picking them out, give you some quick views on each of these. So we're going to start with ADA Cardano. Uh, so this one here, I have, I have an alert sitting on this trend line. Uh, I do like the inverse head and shoulders pattern. The neckline is here. That's ultimately where you'd want to be sort of long, long with size, but I do notice here that the recent drop, uh, managed to stay below the bottom shoulder here. That's a good sign. We're starting to develop more of a complex, uh, or more, more of a deeper shoulder here. Um, I think here, if this can hold this area and start to move higher again, break this red line, it could, it could mean going long with a stop at the lows right here. Uh, and then going long again with a more size kind of on this, uh, on this neckline right here. Okay. Um, so that's what I like about Cardano. I think this looks pretty good overall. Looking at arc here, this has got, it has a really huge spike. I mean, that's just massive 2300. There mustn't be much, a lot of volume in this, but I do like the basing pattern. This also has that, uh, inverse head and shoulders. Look about it. It broke the neckline. It's already out. It, it retested the neckline perfectly. It launched higher. It's come all the way back down. You would think if this is going to continue higher, it's going to do it fairly soon. So this here, uh, this is not for me. It's not my type of trade at the moment. I don't know anything about this, but I know some people have asked about it. Uh, this has potential here, a lot of potential for going and continuing higher. You stop with definitely at a worst case be the lows here on February 16th. Okay. So if you're going to do anything with that kind of like, look at that, it's still quiet, not that far below. It's around a 1250 trading of 14, uh, 1400 to Toshi right now. So, um, that's, that's a spot you can possibly getting long around here. It's sort of clustering here. I could, can break up higher, uh, not a beautiful pattern, but, uh, it does, it has at least broken out of the inverse head and shoulders. So it has the potential to continue higher at this point. And we've seen by these wicks that there's, uh, the potential to push this much higher. Another request, air swap, AST. This chart looks pretty good. Um, nice space, uh, December low, February, February higher low. Um, nice move up here turning again today. This could be a long trade right here. Look at that. Uh, I would say play it nice and, nice and tight. Your stops are right here, uh, at around about eight, eight 79. So, you know, tired enough at least I like this pattern. I think this is a buy Bitcoin cash is looking fairly weak. Um, I did look for a breakout. Uh, didn't, it didn't happen here. It came back down, still trending sideways, unless it breaks this new trend line I've drawn. Um, no real interest here. If anything, this could break lower as far as I'm concerned. Bitcoin cash looks the same as Bitcoin. Sorry. Bitcoin SV looks the same as Bitcoin cash. Apologize about that. Um, nice, pretty flat, uh, nothing really going on here. I, I, I mean, this is going to pump at one point, but it's not looking like it's going to do that now. Binance, what a run looking parabolic for sure. Um, starting in December at the 1200. So at 12,000 level up to 40,000, that's, you know, three X move, um, structure of this definitely looks like it's, uh, you know, going parabolic. I think it might've topped here pretty big reversal candle, but you know what? It's still well above, uh, sort of a 10 day moving average still probably outside of the Bollinger bands. Let me see if I can enable that. Yeah. It's just coming back into the Bollinger bands. It hasn't collapsed yet. If you're long and treating it, you can stay long here. Um, but at some point, you know, this is going to come all the way back down, probably come back into this cluster at some point, which is a sizable decline. Um, but certainly it's going to come back. But the question is when can it go higher? And of course, anything in a parabolic type state can always go higher. So, uh, ENJ engine coin, wow. This, this thing is unreal. I have, this was actually probably like the third or fourth largest altcoin holding of mine. I just dumped around two thirds of it this morning on the market. Um, this is just, it's just too much for me to ignore, you know, coming up from a, what's that, uh, below 950 to 5,000, a five X move in 10 training days. I mean, that's great, right? It's, it's, it's good if you're holding it, but, um, for me, I mean, it's too late to trade. So if you're trading this, I would get out. This is, this is enough. Um, this is rallied way too much. I think this comes crashing back down to kind of the 2000 area, and then it can, it's maybe to rebuy if you, if you want to go long and you like it longterm from a trade, uh, this, this looks like it's, it's run its course perhaps. Um, but yeah, I mean, this just looks great. Uh, I think from a longterm perspective, I also like this one a lot. Um, but again, yeah, this is just run its course. I would be taking profit at this for sure. Somebody asked about civic coin. Um, this is, um, not looking like anything special kind of around the bottom. We had a low low in February. Don't really like too much about this. Now, of course, if the old coin space across the board takes off this, this will go up as well, but in general, nothing, nothing exciting to report here. EOS looks pretty good. In fact, um, I have a trend line here from the other day. It did a bounce. It's looks like it could be going higher again. It's, it's kind of come out of this basing pattern, this inverse head and shoulders pattern. Um, I like this. I'm going to remove that. I think if you go long or if you are long, if you are long, stay long, if you want to go long, you could, uh, the stop would be this bottom candle here. 8,000 for eight, four, two, zero is kind of your stop. Um, I like this shot. This looks pretty good to me. I think EOS has turned the corner. It has put in a pretty long, pretty wide base. And I think this could do something like that and continue higher. So, yep, I definitely like EOS at this point. Well, Ethereum looks like it has a sort of bear market low in place. I've talked about the December low sort of sticking higher low here, but it hasn't really done much since. Um, so just curious to see what this is up about. Uh, I think it, it wants to go higher, but it's, um, yeah, it's just not really responding like I would have hoped. Uh, I, I'm not taking a long trade on this, but if you were long, your stop is probably this candle right here. Obviously the prior cycle low is also a point to be out a hundred percent, but yeah, there's no real, um, nothing really exciting about this chart that wants me to, to jump on this. Some of the altcoins I've shown already seem to have much more promise than what Ethereum is showing right now. Next up is icon ICX. I'm long this. I did an alert on this. It's, uh, looking still constructive at this point. Uh, it's up around, uh, 60 Satoshi around about six or seven percent since the alert, I've moved my stop up slightly up to the March seventh lows here. Um, that is a logical zoom in here. So here I don't want it. My stop was right below the March 4th, sorry, the March ninth candle, moving it up to this candle here. I want to try and get it up to kind of that break even point as fast as possible, which is around about the eight of five. I think it is. Um, yeah. So at this point still showing a potential loss on this trade, if it does reverse, but the chart looks pretty good at this point, it looks like it could rally higher and it's a type of, it's a type of coin that could probably easily make up to around this sort of 11,000 area. So my goal for this, because I'm going to spend a little more time on this because it is a trade. Uh, my goal here would be to get to break even as quick as possible and then look for a sort of a 10% move up to around about maybe the night or actually the peak of this candle today would have been 10%, but look at around about 920, 930, take some profit, and then maybe let the rest ride up to around about the 1100 area for potential profit. So that's what I'm looking at for icon. Another member request from the comment section with self key. I know nothing about this project or this coin first time looking at this chart and I'm not impressed. We have not only do we not have sort of the February cycle low as, uh, as the low, right? We wanted December low to be below because that's, that shows us a higher low, but we have fresh lows in March and that's not good. So this for me is a sell. This is not a good looking chart. Of course it could always rally up, but from what I see here, it just shows relative weakness and I'm not interested in something like that. Now LISC is also showing a February low, not a March low, uh, but at least it seems like it's turning up. So, uh, this one has the potential to surprise. I'm not sure if anybody's really talking too much about it right now. Let's see if we can kind of, yeah, it's, I mean, it's not really, it's not really a nice clean, uh, pattern or anything like that, but it seems like it may want to be, may want to pop out here. Uh, it looks like it might be forming kind of a, um, you know, it's formed a low and it looks like it could be rallying from here. So, uh, not something I'm particularly interested in, but this here has some potential here. If you, if you kind of know this coin, you know, the way it trades, um, you know, and you're comfortable with it, then there's an opportunity here. Of course the cluster of candles recently around the 3,100, less than a 10% move is your stop point. Um, even the 10 day moving average could be a stop point as well, make it much tighter. So this one here I'll kind of like, um, not a huge fan, but this is constructive and it looks like it might be starting to make a move higher. Of course, Litecoin is the darling, uh, at the moment making massive moves higher. Um, my experience over many, many years of trading is that when something is dramatic, dramatically outperforming everything else that's pushing the upper Bollinger bands, that is extremely overboard on the RSI and stay with it. Don't go against it. All right. So you either want to be not touching it. Um, or you want to be riding it, you don't want to be shorting it, never want to short something that's strong like this. This is a beautiful looking uptrend. It's taking out prior, uh, sort of pivots and cluster points during the down decline. Uh, nothing, nothing negative to say about this. Now, of course, you're going to get some pretty sharp pullbacks a lot. Um, and, and those are probably good buying opportunities. Like for example, now it's sort of stretched out of, from this cluster here, from this sort of flag pattern has now rallied. So it could either trade sideways for a while, it could dramatically come back to kind of the, the trend line or the mean or the 10 day moving average. And that would in theory be another, um, another point of entry as well. So this looks good overall. MKR has been on a good run and I think it's looking like it wants to go on another run here. Um, let's have a look at this. Yeah, this, this, this is looking pretty good here. I think this is consolidating all these gains. Um, it doesn't look like it's going to roll over. If it did, then you're probably looking at the lows from, uh, I think it's Monday or Tuesday right there as a stopping point. This could be a long trade or you can wait for kind of a breakout of, uh, you know, kind of this line that I've drawn here, which is sort of the top of each of the daily candles, um, loosely at least. Um, but yeah, this is, this is looking pretty good. I think this based on this strength, I like that this could be a sort of a, uh, consolidation here, some profit taking before maybe going on another run of similar sort of length. So at least something that, uh, sort of covers this length here from this breakout, seeing another one of those go up to the sort of a 0.22, 0.23 area as well. Um, we've kind of got a good reset in some of the technicals. So this looks pretty good overall. Um, I'm not sure if I would take it right now, but, um, it does look pretty good. Yeah. Ontology is a request that I had in the comments, uh, looking good. Yeah. This has got a base. This has got a December low that's lower. February low. That's kind of a double bottom. Good move higher from here. Come back down to 10 day moving average coming back up. I think this is a long, I'm not taking it, but this is a definitely a long stop is, uh, the candle from the weekend. I think it is that, um, that would be an indication if it was to go below that it's probably doing a double top. So if it did this, that's an out for sure. But you know, it's coming off a double bottom here. It's had a good move, consolidated, some profit taking and that's coming back up. I think this has potential to go much higher at this point, at least to sort of this area here. Okay. And then looking back, there's plenty of room above to go further. Raven coin. Wow. This one has become popular. A lot of requests for this. Uh, I missed it this time around, even though I had an alert set on this very trend line. Can you believe that it's just the way the way trading works? Um, I had it for the first move higher, and that was a really big, uh, profit winner for me. And I also had it posted on alerts here at Bitcoin live, but not this time, um, dramatically overbought extended, but that's how some of these, uh, breakouts and pops in the alts work. Right. But I don't know what to tell you right here. It's still above the Bollinger bands. It hit almost, uh, the 1000 Satoshi level. That was kind of the top right here as well. Even though we had this really big wick all the way up to sort of 10 50, I think it was, but Hey, this is a double top at the moment. And I'm not sure what else you'd be looking for coming out of a 250, 300 base, a three X move. That's kind of enough, right? If you're trading this, you want to be watching it really closely because um, you know, if, if you want to hold and maintain this trajectory and hold your position, you've got to give it a lot of room. A lot of room means giving up maybe 200 to 300 Satoshi just to stay in position. Good chance that if you keep doing that all the way up that you're gonna, you're gonna end up sort of selling at this 900 level, 900 level. Anyway, my, my point is that if you hold now with a 300 Satoshi sort of trailing stop, it goes up to sort of 1100 and then you're still holding that 300 Satoshi trailing stop. It's going to pull all the way back eventually to 900 and take you out of position. So if I was in a position right now, I'd be scaled out pretty, pretty significantly by this three X move here. And then looking at this candle as well, I would be potentially, I would, I would pretty much be getting out at this point, to be honest with you. I'd keep some, maybe just to keep writing it, right? Cause you want to, you want to, you want to try and maximize a move like this, but after a three X move, or even a two X move, in fact, but after three X move, it's like, Hey, take, take your profits big enough. It's way more than you expected. I'm sure if you went long, the breakout, you really weren't thinking 900 Satoshi, you were probably thinking 500 would be phenomenal. So if you've, you know, if you've managed to hold this long, kudos, right? That's a clap for you. You've done great, but probably banks and profit and move on as far as I'm concerned.

{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-24?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas on April the 24th. hope you're doing really well. so I have a bit of a change in format now going forward. the Friday lightning report was just getting far too big for me to handle, too many requests and I think a lot of the coins were simply not coins that people were necessarily following. so what I'm going to do here is change the Wednesday which Wednesday report, which has been typically a midweek update on Bitcoin and some of the other majors that may be moving, and make that a top 10 market report. so Monday will be the full Bitcoin cycles report, going over the daily and weekly chart. Wednesday will now be the top 10 coin report, where I cover the top 10 coins, and then Friday's lightning report will be 15 coins- 15 maybe to 20 at the most of coins outside of the top 10, and they can be any market cap based on feedback from you and what you want to see. so I will be monitoring the comment section for now, going forward, let's start with this post and the comments in that post and the requests that you have in terms of looking at altcoins and seeing where there may be some opportunity. so please post your requests in the comments. I will also skim through, before the report, my list that I've gone through in the past for lightning reports and take a look at anything that I believe is of interest. so something that could be a potential setup, something that should be on your watch list, something that has the room or the opportunity to go to go higher. so that's the new format. I think that's going to work a lot better than sort of a 40 or 50 minute lightning report. this way I'll get to spend a little more time on the analysis as well, and especially the top 10. here I'll get a chance to be more focused on those coins going forward because there will be a weekly recurring deeper dive into those. okay, so that's the update. I will just use coin market caps- US dollar coin market cap- to to find the top 10. obviously, tether will not be part of that. so number 11, tron, will be part of the top 10 and today I'll go through each of those for you as well as bitcoin. sit back and enjoy. okay, the btc update. well, bitcoin, I think, still looks great to me. we are touching the upper and actually have exceeded the upper bollinger bands. we had this tightening, rising but tightening uh process over the last few weeks. I said on Monday that I liked this setup. I thought this can still go higher and indeed on Tuesday we did go considerably higher, another sort of 200 higher. so this is still trending higher coming back today and it could go back a few more days. but, um, the fact that we are comfortably above the 10 and 20 day moving average, riding the upper bollinger bands- still relatively- I wouldn't call it early in the cycle, but at least before the typical midpoint of the cycle- I think that overall is a reason to at least remain bullish here or at least expect to continue the uptrend until we see evidence that that uptrend is no longer in play. while price remains in this type of trend, you want to respect that. you want to either be just uh long from a, from a long-term position and not necessarily leverage, but you don't want to be looking for shorts. picking tops in any uptrend is a mugs game or a losers game. don't, don't fall for that it is. it is a a nice feeling to think that you may be able to pick tops in an uptrend, but, um, you know, trust me, it, it, it. you will get one eventually and you'll feel good about it, but in the long run you'll get cut to death. trying to short a market that is rallying at this, best to wait for a nice trend lower to emerge, whether it's late in the cycle to short, otherwise you want to be riding with the trend at this time. at the moment it's still higher now. if the cycle low was right here on the day 47, then today marks day 30, which is around the midpoint. so we are getting kind of into that danger period or the period where it could start to turn lower. but again, we still need to see evidence that it's going to turn lower. we still have- we have, for god's sake, five month highs right here on this candle, uh yesterday. so, uh, with five month highs just in place, you don't want to be shorting the market at this point, all right. let's take a look at ethereum here. don't like what i saw overnight. i was liking the action a couple days ago but really thinking now that my long ethereum trade is going to get stopped out here, such as the nature of the markets, but the fact that we dropped back below the 10 and 20 day moving average, um, when it should have continued higher from right this area here after after retracing the breakout point. i think coming back a second time to the breakout point is not a good sign at all. so, um, not looking good here. i think it still has a final chance. it's really going to move today or tomorrow. to be honest, with you not looking good, i think by friday we're either going to be closed out or stopped out, or sharply higher. at that point i don't think it's going to, i don't think it's going to hang around this area for too much longer. the bollinger bands are starting to get really tight and i think it's either going to break down pretty sharply and come back down to the 140 area, or it's going to break considerably higher. at this point, something to watch out for. but, uh, yeah, just unfortunately, just not not following through. and that's the way markets- um, you know markets- behave. it sometimes just got to look back at it and say: well, you know, was the chart pattern correct? was my entry correct? was my risk defined? well, if all those boxes are ticked correctly, then it's just a matter of accepting what the market gives us. and then, looking at ethereum to btc- see, this here is part of the problem as well. we are now, uh, breaking lower. uh, i'm not sure if we have new lows, necessarily, but, um, let's just draw across here. no, we're not. well, actually that bounced off, perfectly, almost so bounced off, uh. 029740973. okay, so almost a double bottom here from uh, this february low, still nowhere near the december lows. i think they're going to hold, but it looks like here we are going to exceed this february low and come down lower. so, overall, not exciting action here. um, from ethereum, and i think this is also telling us a lot of what we're seeing on the uh, the altcoin space in general, where a lot of charts have broken down, and we'll go over that on friday, but many of the charts are now broken down. uh, i think whatever altcoin move we've had is now over. for the time being. i think we're looking at retracing, but, uh, opportunities will come again, of course, but right now this looks like it's- uh, it's it's testing lower, probably a bounce back up, maybe something like this, and then, as we head lower into the next cycle low for bitcoin in may, i think we may get down to kind of this area here by the end of may where the bitcoin cycle low is due, and then we can build up again from there. so at the moment, not looking good here for ethereum going forward now. i really wish i had shorted xrp ripple here. i've pretty much been all over this move for, i would say, three months. my analysis has been very consistent: that we have a well-defined downtrend that you should respect, that you should not buy and that you should not be taking a position thinking that you'll get this big spike up at any given time. this is a perfect example of why you don't try and pick bottoms in a downtrend and you don't try and pick tops in an uptrend. it's a fool's game. as i said with the bitcoin analysis, this is a downtrend and when it got to this area in march, that downtrend begin began to accelerate lower. now we're- now we're putting in some deeper candles here. i think it's probably oversold enough. probably we'll get a bounce. but again, you don't play a bounce in this type of market because the downtrend, the trend on the longer time frame, intermediate time frame- is still lower. we've broken below this sort of arbitrary support line that i have here intersecting two prior points. nothing significant about those two points. we've had other periods like this one here where it's gone significantly lower. i think there isn't much of an opportunity here unless we get down to this sort of 4 000 level on on ripple versus bitcoin um. so you know- and now that we're sort of seem to be capitulating almost- that that decline could um could begin to really accelerate, as it has more recently, but almost become a complete sort of swan swan dive drop all the way down to the 4 000 area, maybe down at this 4 000 area. if it does find the bottom and reverse, put in a swing low, then maybe there's an opportunity to get long, but right now this is something you want to avoid. bitcoin cash, abc um. it's been performing well lately. it's, uh, more than doubled against bitcoin of late. it has somewhat of an uptrend in play. but unfortunately, if you look at more recent action here- let's see if we can take a look at this- so we had a top on this spike. we had a retrace back towards the 10- 20 day moving average. that's great. it tried to go higher again, failed to make a new high and now has made a new low. so that's a definition of a trend change right there. so we have a high that did not make a higher high. then we now have a breakdown and a low that's made a lower low, so this has to be respected. i think this is going to continue to come down low at this point. this also has a lot to do with bitcoin's- uh, more more dominant run of late, so this pair is probably showing more weakness because bitcoin is showing more strength than anything else and you probably will see that show up a little more here on the dollar chart. see, on the dollar chart we don't have a new high like same as bitcoin, but yet we do not have a lower low, and that's because bitcoin itself has performed really well as opposed to the dollar. so versus the dollar, this list is looking more, a little bit more like a flag pattern. tightening bollinger bands could go higher, but you would probably still need bitcoin to come back a little bit. i'm not sure if that's the case. so this is kind of a neutral chart for me. um, if if bitcoin versus abc here had held the line as well, then i would think this would be more bullish. but this development here leads me to believe it's starting to break down a little bit as well, and especially if bitcoin starts to find the top in this cycle, a 60 day cycle, the entire sector will get dragged down. i think this will also suffer. uh on on the bitcoin versus abc, but also a bitcoin versus the dollar chart as well. i think this would begin to break down. so at the moment, caution. not a horrible looking chart overall, um, but certainly something to be cautious about and i don't really see much of an opportunity to trade this at this time. okay, eos: i said uh before that this chart was looking good- eos versus dollar, that it was consolidating bounds again. bands were getting tighter- but it's gone the other way. this also is uh something we're seeing across the board now in many of the altcoins. eos is breaking down. this is a sign. uh, now, for long term, i'm not phased at all. this is a beautiful move off the dollar 50.. i think this will come back now quite a bit maybe into this sort of cluster. three dollar range- not a reason to get out from a long-term perspective. from a shorter term trading standpoint, you want to be out now. this is breaking down and not something you want to uh be long for. from a trade standpoint, eos- btc is showing a more pronounced, significant drop below any sort of level. i said before. that would be, um, something to get me out of. so this is now: and avoid, do not be trading this at all. eos is breaking down, could retrace back kind of all the way down to this sort of level here, even down to this initial point triangle point where it broke out. uh, anything's possible, especially if the altcoin space is going to have another month or so down. um, you know, i think i think people got very excited about the altcoin space recently, pretty much put a lot of money and capital back to work, and now i think this is taking some of that back. all right, litecoin, very similar trends, big up trends- are now breaking down. um, another reason why we use stops: right, uh, here's another point where i said: if you're going to go long, get long, but you want to be out at that point if it breaks below, lower, and this is the reason why we use stops. we always want to minimize our risk. if you're still holding this, then you know, i don't know it could bounce back, but you won't. you don't want to be holding these. if you're just trading these, if you're going to be, if you're, if you're investing long term, of course you don't care about these types of charts. but if you're trading this, then you should have been out right here. minimize your losses. you take it, taking a small loss, and move on. right now you're holding the bag on a 15- 20 loss here on the position and that hurts and it's probably hard to get out because of that. my advice is just always cut your losses and get out if it's if it's gone beyond your initial plan, because what happens is if it keeps going much lower than you and eventually end up puking that position because the losses are so steep that you can't handle it anymore. so if you're in that position, i would advise personally to to get out of it at the moment. no trade here long. it's come back a very long way. it needs to re-establish some type of uptrend. right now it's completely broken that trend. it's below previous sort of consolidation areas where they rallied. this would have been kind of the final straw area. see right here: um, getting below that and even the wick that you saw on this massive candle here. even that it's below that. so nothing here of interest for litecoin. it's now a broken uptrend and we don't know if this means that this trend will spend a period of time doing something like this. okay, over the next month or two before forming a new low. this was a beautiful move, but all beautiful moves, at least in the short term- intermediate trend come to an end, and this one looks like it has come to an end. okay, binance coin is about the only coin that still has an uptrend in play. but be careful with this, right? let's put in here: so: higher high: that's the last high versus the most recent high, versus the high before. higher high: that's great. now you want to put in some point here on the recent low. okay, so that's your stop point, right. if it gets below that point, you now have a trend change. it's still looking pretty good. it's at the 10 and 20 day moving average. what concerns me, though, is that all the other coins and all the other majors have pretty much already broken down, and this has had a very big move since november. it hasn't really stopped going higher, so at some point there's going to be some really significant profit taking. you would think it's something like this: it's up 400 and there's a lot of people who are sitting on some really fat gains on this, and once the momentum changes and turns, then you'll see a massive- you know- deceleration and sell off. it doesn't mean it's bearish for binance in the longer term, but everything has an ebb and flow, action to it and at some point this will have a reversal back. think of it like a pendulum swinging. at some point, once the pendulum reaches the other end, it starts to come back and get and gather momentum. that's what will happen eventually. i'm not saying it's gonna happen now, but, based on the whole crypto space in general and how it's already turned, you would want to, you'd want to believe, or you should believe, that this is probably going to turn at some point. at the moment, still like the uptrend, just keep, keep, you know, be aware of some of these important areas, certainly for breaks and closes on a daily below the 10 and 20 day moving average, you should be concerned on this xlm, i can't believe this is a top 10 coin, but it is. guys, be careful of this. this is not a good looking chart. i think it's breaking down. i think we're seeing the start of it right here. we had this. here it's more. it's not a bear flag but, um, when the entire space rallies sharply and this barely made a, you know, i mean it's up 50, don't get me wrong, but compared to everything else, um, it didn't do as much. and now we have a 10 day moving average below the 20. it's touching the lower bollinger bands. the entire space is breaking down. uh, i think this is going to go much lower. it may even test, in my opinion, the february lows by the time this move is over with. so be very careful with stella. i do not like this at all. cardano, look at this, guys, all the way back to the breakout point. okay, and- and there's a couple of things i just want to mention here and hopefully, as being members of bitcoin live, part of what we want to do, and certainly what i want to do, is not spoon feed ideas and trades that i'm doing, necessarily, but to teach you or to at least, uh, walk through the process and the thinking behind what i do and the trades i do. that's the most important takeaway, and what i said clearly and multiple times with ada was that we get in early on these chart identification patterns and we start to take our profit. we took some profit up in this sort of 1600 and then, somewhere around the 1800 area, we took two-thirds of the profit on this banked a really good profit. but some people- i know this because i got some emails or some texts, um some some dms, i should say- on asking what we should do. um, some people were kind of looking at this upper area. i certainly was, but i was looking at that upper area with a third, a final third, of my position, not with my profits. i took enough of the profits out where i didn't mind seeing this come back down lower. obviously didn't want to see it come back lower, but the point is that i was prepared for this lower by taking some profit early. of course, it's more of an art form than it is a science in terms of how much profit taken when you take it, but the fact that you know when the market gives you something, you want to take something off the table to allow you to then be able to weather something like this. i think what some people end up doing here is some people didn't buy the initial break of this. they bought this break here and now they're at break even and if they keep holding that full position now, they're going to end up probably puking out at a loss when they sat on the 30 and 40 profit. so just be aware of that. uh, if you are in that boat where you bought in at the breakout and have not sold anything, then i got to be honest with you. i think you start to get out here, take your break even and and use that as a lesson, because what's going to happen is, or what could happen is, this could continue higher all the way back down to this march and february lows and let's extend that out. okay, it could come back all the way to here and i think you would end up puking your position right, probably when the market's going to turn. so just be aware of that. but look as analysis, i don't necessarily like much about this and i think this is just again a symptom of the entire all coin space. it's going through a correction at the moment and this could find support right here, potentially at least maybe come back up for a few days, like something like this, right, but then i think, based on this, it's going to come back down lower and break below that point. so something to be aware of. okay, let's finish with coin number 10 on the market cap tron. so overall, this is a beautiful base, right, but again, failed breakout here and now it came back down, tried to come back up, didn't do anything and is now breaking down, touching the lower bollinger bands for the second time. this, like everything else, is a warning, i think. if we go back and look at the february and march, like we did, ada, i think we are looking at a retest of that zone. let's draw that here. so somewhere in this area here over the next coming month would probably be a good position again to trying and maybe establish a position and then we're looking at maybe a retest of this sort of neckline or this zone, at least probably not until june or july on the next cycle, and then maybe a break higher and above. so for now, this is an avoid. long term again, like anything else, these are good positions to be in price wise, but the charts are not showing any trade opportunity from a, you know, short and intermediate term time frame for tron. okay, guys, let's finish with a little summary here. summary is that bitcoin is performing well, but the entire altcoin space is underperforming and actually in the corrective mode. all the charts are bearish, some of the altcoins that we're not covering today, so the top sort of uh 10 to 30 market cap coins are showing horrible chart patterns. be very aware, guys. you want to be um, sitting on the sidelines for this. let the market correct. don't try and find bottoms in a downtrend. this downtrend has only really just gotten started. it hasn't um, it hasn't really been in play for a significant amount of time yet, even though there's pretty significant corrections already. uh, you see that i'm on the sidelines, have been mostly on the sidelines for a number of weeks now, for that very reason. when the charts start breaking down, then there just isn't a trade for me to have. a lot of. you are trying to force your hand on the market, trying to force the situation, and you have recency bias in mind, meaning that you loved the- uh, the, the uptrend of the last few months, the, the profits that you were showing, at least on paper, um, and now you kind of uh, longing for those days again and trying to pick up these, uh, these coins. on pullbacks, not the time for that. i think we still have more of a pullback to come. be patient, sit in cash, sit in bitcoin, if you have to, um, and let's just wait for opportunities to present themselves. they will come, but we need to be selective and mindful and patient to be able to capitalize, because what happens is it's so easy to make a good run, a good profit, in an altcoin run-up and it's so easy to give it all back and more. okay, so please think about that, incorporate that into your strategy and incorporate that more into your thinking. when you're looking for a trade, ask yourself: what am i doing here? if i'm looking for something, then i'm probably taking inferior setups and i'm taking a trade that's not ticking all of my boxes and you're taking a trade just for the sake of trading. so try to avoid that and be mindful. hopefully you like this new format. the top 10 coin review on wednesdays. give me your requests for all coins for the friday lightning report. until then, be well and happy trading.",

{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-05?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members it's Bob Lucas it is Friday morning here in New York this is your weekly lightning report where I cover around about 30 odd different coins most at the request of members take a quick look at each of the charts the disclaimer here is that I am trading very few of these and many of these I'm looking at for the first time or I have not looked at at all since last Friday's report so you are getting essentially a very quick view high level view of the chart as I see it with very little sort of time for analysis and study so that's that's the disclaimer take it for what it's worth it's just an idea that maybe will help in your own strategy or your own setup or your own identification that being said we always start off with a quick update on Bitcoin being the main driver of this industry or the sector and right now again from a cycle timing standpoint we're going to have to wait probably a week or two before we get some firm idea on where the cycle low will be to me it looks like we have this time-based consolidation here that resulted in this massive surge looks like it wants to hold these gains at the moment I think they would have been reversed by now I would say looks like they want to continue to go higher we are only still actually right now technically I believe we are above the Bollinger Band still so we're still consolidating or profit taking this big move higher it looks like it's holding pretty well could be forming a flag here as well and that could mean that we will once this once this move is consolidated and let's just take a quick look at this this is a very crude way of determining this but if you look at the poles here you know wherever you put that essentially if we get this sideways chop let's say if it's just like kind of like a pennant form of some type we could still see a pretty sizable move in more of a continuation come out of that so looking up towards that kind of that 58 to 6 000 level that provided a lot of support that turned that failed into this kind of bear market lows that would probably be the peak of this cycle when it comes I don't know when that's going to come but that would be the upper range it looks like it wants to continue higher but again we are now kind of in this no man's land area that I talked about yesterday and during the week and in this area here I think there's a lot more let's just call it free air that is going to allow Bitcoin to kind of oscillate a little more wildly and it's going to be difficult to kind of trade this area being right here and knowing that this is probably going to be some firm resistance there really isn't much upside here to be had and there's an equal amount of almost downside you can almost argue that the two tops here will become support but that's not guaranteed at all but even if you argued and you were right that this was a support line now and this was now a resistance line we're right in the middle of that so there isn't much from a risk reward standpoint that I like in terms of getting long leveraged wise I'm talking about at this point now from obviously from an investment standpoint or even from a trading standpoint having your account in BTC is not a bad thing you don't want to be left behind if and it's a big if if we get some kind of really weird strength right or ridiculous move we just don't know with an asset like this you don't know if you get this right it's a possibility so we always want to have at least a base exposure one-to-one exposure to Bitcoin we want to be in my opinion denominated in Bitcoin in our trading accounts even we don't have sort of an active position you're sitting in Bitcoin just in case you get these types of moves ideally I think what we're gonna see or what I'd like to see is more of a and let me look at this more of a kind of just a gradual get up there come back down and then form kind of a cycle low like this kind of filling in this whole area here there's no man's land without necessarily crashing down in price that ideally would be the most bullish case this would be an early cycle low this would be another cycle low and then that puts us firmly into a nice new trend of higher highs and higher lows at that point and putting behind us almost definitively the December lows as being the bear market lows again this is what I see for Bitcoin again not much of a risk reward opportunity for for the active or leveraged traders of you out there but again be aware of potential upside surprises but at the same time you know don't be concerned if it comes crashing back into this into this area down here it takes a long time to come out of the basement of a bear market out of a crypto winter so don't be surprised with anything coming back lower as well at this point okay so let's get into the lightning report I'm sorry if I missed a coin that you requested there was just too many out there this report is obviously edited as well so this takes me well over a sort of an hour and a half by the time I review each of the charts and then you know provide commentary and so forth so please accept my apology in advance it's just getting too long of a list um but I'll do my best to get to yours as well so here we go ADA cardano very big profit winner uh for me and hopefully for you two thirds out staying one third in I love the uptrend could see a good sizable pullback at this point have my stop set right here it's actually 14.50 um but have that stop just there because I think if it gets down to that level we could be looking at you know more of a more of a move back down um and this being a really sort of being the end of this kind of move but at the same time I want to give it some room some good size room here to be able to continue higher goal is at least 2400 at this point at 24 I might come out of the position but uh even that's not a huge amount of upside from here I may even be looking uh just holding this a little more long term see what the see what the market can give us but something at around the 3000 level would definitely probably get me out that would be around about 250 profit from the entry I think that would be enough for me at that point as well arc has broken down from last week I think I drew this I said this could be a long trade a lot of these did get hit in the short term because bitcoin did rally hard so anything against bitcoin is going to see a lot of these charts I believe as I go through these but I put in this line here for a stop and it went right through it so this is now out could recover but the setup is now gone and I don't like anything about this chart from here going forward air swap also has a similar pattern come down on the on the on the bitcoin surge come below a line I said that we do not want to cross this does not look not look bullish anymore although we do have kind of a round of bottoms to in play this could just be a reaction and now it could set up higher again but again nothing clear and clean that I like about this for going forward that is a new one added for this week overall I like this this is a good yeah this is a very um okay this is the first time I'm looking at this for the and I like the fact that we've got uh we've got an actual parity here with bitcoin even though we've got some wild swings we do see uh it's it's held its value against bitcoin whereas most coins went down sharply for the longest time so this is very positive we see kind of a clear cycle pattern here evolving but we do have a breakout as well so this is a good looking chart I think from a lot I don't know anything about the the project so take that for what it's worth but from a chart structure standpoint I like this a lot and I think this looks like it may be setting up for a new kind of uptrend or a new series of higher prices out of this block now that we potentially also have an altcoin bear market low behind us I do like this one I like it not so much from a an immediate trade opportunity but I like it from a long-term chart perspective bitcoin cash abc well it was only a matter of time before this rocketed higher I knew it would just couldn't work out when it would that's the that's obviously the challenge in trading but this looks pretty good at the moment now we do see the past a lot of times we get these two three day moves and it fails or fizzles more than anything else I don't know if that's this is kind of the extent of the move it's hard to really say um but the uptrend is in place it's just hard to buy an uptrend at this point if you if you are in this or if you kind of traded that I would just stay in this and and like we did with binance and few of the other coins uh in enj when they went up like this just keep riding them but give yourself some safe distance probably the bottom of this bar here would be kind of your get out point I would say maybe slightly below that how it's always tricky trading kind of a massive move like this because you want to give it room to continue higher but at the same time you don't want to give up too much of your profits doing that so it's always a fine battle or balance between the two I should say um in this case you want to give it some room because I do think it's consolidating and it could go higher again and you know this this doesn't give it justice because this is post fork with bitcoin sv but when you look at history before that which is bitcoin cash we do see uh we did see sort of kind of really big moves over like many weeks sometimes so it's possible that this is going to do something like that here as well where it just um you know it just kind of goes up for maybe like two or three weeks gets to who knows where at point point one point one five you just don't know where exactly so if you're on this trend stay with it is the point bitcoin sv um of course I don't like anything about this project but and it doesn't really have much of a price history to go on really tight kind of just down trending not doing much this one has the potential you would think right and all these do but this one has the potential as well to give us a good pump at some point problem is how do you position yourself for that I don't see how you can and therefore it's not something I'm interested in but um you know I wouldn't be surprised one day if we see just you know this kind of just do that as well okay um because this is fairly fairly cheap I guess um anything below kind of 0.05 or five percent of bitcoin it has a potential to get up there at least in the short term um based on the characters involved with this project finance coin I think the uptrend is still in play obviously got hit with bitcoin going up so sharply still at a reasonable point I think this last week this is where last week's kind of stop point still above that point although we kind of seem to be rolling uh rounding over uh I wouldn't say rolling over but sort of definitely forming around the top top but overall you know the so the trajectory or that sort of parabolic trend line has kind of been broken at this point um nothing nasty though and explainable because of that bitcoin surge I think this can still recover and continue higher at this point I think if you were trading it give it some more give it more patience and more room uh but keep kind of this line here I think as your stopping point because anything kind of below that would really change or alter the dynamics of this chart and I think if you got below that line it would look more more like a topping pattern is in play um right if it broke down below that um right if it broke down below that so I think sort of maintaining and staying above that low there is important for the structure of this chart to continue higher bit shares looks pretty good December lows rounded bottom uh got hit obviously like everything else did but still still moving higher higher I like this if you're long this or could be a long-term position I think this chart looks really nice and I would stick with it for sure civic coin was doing really well and then got slammed by that bitcoin move down 15 20 percent if you had the stop below that point you got stopped out unfortunately that's just the way trading goes sometimes we uh we have stops for that reason this could conceivably start to recover again and continue that trend higher and I wouldn't be surprised if it did that but again now that now that the chart is busted for the short term it's hard to get back in if you're a long-term believer in the project if it's more of an investment then I can see this is a good spot to get back in but if you're trading I don't see the opportunity to do anything at this point however dash is a good looking chart we had the good move lower with bitcoin the other day but this seems to now be stepping up so we can start to consider sort of a new trend going up at that point kind of what litecoin did starting back in december dash could be beginning to sort of form that new level we could be looking at sort of another step right here I think if you like I know a lot of people like dash from a long-term standpoint I would be long if you do like it for sure even from a trading standpoint you can try and find a spot where it comes back towards this 10-day moving average here like you see here and then pick your spot and then get in and then ride the next wave higher I do like it I think this has you know a december low as well where we see a lot of the altcoins finding finding a low and then stepping up since then so you've even got another step right here so we're looking at sort of four steps you've got higher highs as well so this is a nice looking chart and something you if you're an intermediate type type trader or an investor you can still get in long here give yourself a smaller position maybe even a wider stop even use this one here as your stop for example which is considerably lower but then obviously you'd have a smaller position and then let yourself kind of let it kind of come up and into this sort of um 34 000 38 000 range uh to to compensate for that so wider stop longer profit target that's one way to potentially trade this or invest in this as well ENJ engine coin is one of my long-term holdings I think it's coming back to earth now talked about that before I'm still holding half of my initial position took half profit somewhere up here coming where it was exactly now but this looks like it's coming back down probably going to retrace the majority of this move often often coins would do that or assets would do that so I wouldn't be surprised if it gets down to this level I wouldn't be surprised if it gets down to the original breakout point so there's no trade to be had here in my opinion um this is something you want to be avoiding at this time until this downtrend settles and forms a new bottom EOS I like I am I have a long-term position in EOS uh this looks like it's a well not looks like it is a new uptrend we've kind of broken a inverse head and shoulders we have a December low stepping higher this is definitely a coin I think you want to have exposure to I'm not saying or even believe it's going to sort of beat out Ethereum for the next sort of in the next phase but it's going to be a contender and it certainly has a lot of interests and it has a lot of room on the chart to move higher as well so EOS is something I like and I think people should have a long-term position in for sure I like the chart of ETC Ethereum Classic I think the project is a waste of time but um we hit a trade and this could pull back a little bit but to me this looks like we could be at least heading back to this sort of cluster here where it really broke down in October November we do have a breakout a similar chart pattern to to many many of the other cryptos uh Monero for example has something similar but this has moved up and I think it can continue higher but cool could also easily pull back to the sort of 10 and 20 day moving average as it goes higher so pick pick your spots on this one it looks like the trend is now up so that's that's the first good sign the theorem to Bitcoin is surprisingly not doing much um obviously against the dollar it's done okay but this against Bitcoin is underperforming um not sure what to make of that whether this is more about Ethereum and development issues that they're having scaling and so forth or if this is a sort of precursor to kind of an altcoin uh shake out this could be coming up as well both kind of have valid ideas um right now I want to sort of think it's I'm still pulling back but the the February lows probably will provide enough support to keep it from going lower something we want to pay attention to for sure when you look at it versus the dollar though it has underperformed if you think about now it is kind of exceeding uh the February and January highs that we have so it's kind of trying to make a higher high uh we can remove this from last week it's outperformed the dollar but everything has outperformed the dollar as Bitcoin has rallied uh you would have thought Ethereum um Ethereum would have done something kind of like this um already like Litecoin has and others so a little concerned about what what this is telling us or what this could be telling us or what it's doing right now but at the same time I wouldn't be surprised if it does break out sharply and then makes another good move uh from here could also look at this from uh kind of like an ascending triangle although not very clean but uh we do have a lower low here um and not really not so much here as a touch point but we have a couple touch points at the top here similar structure to many of the other charts so if we do get a breakout we could probably get like a 60 80 move as well Ethereum can and does surprise us often like that and if it has formed the bottom like I think they all have then we could eventually uh this could eventually be kind of a lager and make up room very rapidly and get to this zone here and let's just take a look at what that might be so kind of in the uh 180 to 230 range is is possible I think that would be the resistance in the next move but getting up into that box if it can get moving is a possibility for sure nothing I like about go not enough history here don't see a trade set up um overall it's flat so nothing nothing unfortunate here that I could add any value to you with Grin had a little move higher but now it's moving back down overall the chart looks very grim so Grin is grim at the moment um not seeing anything to change my mind definitely caution on um hollow here um looks like it could be breaking down I would definitely avoid this one uh only 26 satoshi so this must be one of these um all coins uh penny stock all coin types this looks like it's breaking down so nothing to report here ICX holding up icon um looks like a around the bottom February low could go either way I think I want to see another move higher the bollinger bands are getting tight so this could move higher at this point uh different levels that we have I think we want to see at least a move above here before looking at this again but I will add an alert on this one getting above that might be an opportunity because of how tight the bands are here as well and has some good consolidation and looks like around the bottom as well so this could move higher if it gets above that point self key looks horrible doing nothing breaking down I would avoid this one length looks pretty good um although it could be could be breaking down at this point you kind of want to be careful at that level there but if you zoom kind of out this has a nice uptrend in play um oh look at this this is actually outperformed in 2000 2018 you had this move but since since since November um it really has put in a nice new uptrend here this is a seller looking chart so this is a definitely a long-term buy in my opinion this chart looks like it could be a leader in any any new move in the l coin space so I like this one as well and this one could be a buy in this area here and then give it some kind of give it some room as well so I definitely like chain link LISC is also another one I like um not so much from a project standpoint but from a chart standpoint although it doesn't have a December low has a February low it looks like it is forming a new uptrend a couple of points here you want to watch for you want to if you want to go long you're going to want to find your spots kind of just pop below a spot I drew last week here here's another low here but this looks like it could be a new sold uptrend something uh for long-term holders to be aware of that this is this is now a nice uptrend you want to give it enough space enough room to rally higher and move higher at that point from a trading standpoint don't see much in the short term as an opportunity um but definitely stick with this for people that like the project Litecoin continues to impress continue to make the moves higher uh called this correctly unfortunately the surge in Bitcoin for a brief moment there just knocked uh knocked the position out and then rallied higher such as life and such as trading we move on uh would have been a really nice 15 20 move already from this point but not to be but I still overall love this chart I think Litecoin can continue moving higher I think we will though at some point get another consolidation it seems like this um this percentage move is similar to this one and this one and this one therefore I I would suggest that we're going to get a move back lower consolidate the gains and then we can go higher again certainly Litecoin from a longer term perspective is one that you want to have exposure to even though it is up to kind of 90 already off a 20 move Litecoin is the type of coin that you don't necessarily want to look at the the prior price move and say oh it's gone already because it does does it does ridiculous moves now again it'll probably pull back at some point maybe even back to the 70 dollar range which would be a definite buy but considering it's gone as high as 400 in the past I think it was it still has plenty of room to go as well so don't discount or undervalue Litecoin it certainly has a very high beta to Bitcoin a meta coin has come back down to earth I like this one from a long term I have a long term position in this but had this huge run and come back down no trade to be had here it doesn't look like it looks like it's stuck in this trading range and probably will be for a while so avoid from a trading standpoint MKR had some good looking charts but now it looks like it's breaking down so this is an avoid for me if you're a long term holder or want to be a long term holder you may be able to pick up a good price if you're patient somewhere down here I would think in an uptrend this level here will act as support so there's it's pretty close to that but there's some room still lower at this point maybe another 10% if not more if you're so again if you're a long term believer or holder getting in even some position now but getting in down this area I think would be probably a good long term buy for you as well from a trading standpoint I don't see anything I like hey OMG is really working out kind of how I thought I think I drew this chart trend line in many weeks ago and look at that it's just up consolidation up consolidation a little further back than you would think but that's probably expected considering bitcoin's move let's bounce right back up so this one I like I think this one has good long term potential if you like this project this is a nice looking chart new uptrend pick your right spots and get in definitely I would recommend this one for sure ONT looks interesting it did break up it's held that area quite quite well I think this is consolidating it might might chop a little more sideways at this point get the bollinger bands why do I always pick the wrong tool okay chop sideways bollinger bands tight and then come up again so I think this one looks pretty good I'm going to actually take this and move it up to around about there give me a warning if it does break out and then that could be a stop this would be your target for the next move so keeping an eye on this I like this structure if you're long this from an investment standpoint stay long good looking chart looks like a definitive bottom here so overall looks pretty positive to me Qtum had a run here the other day took me out of my position so I'm out of this one from a trading standpoint not as in love with it as I was it didn't hasn't really broken out yet but I think if it does break out from here we we want to take another look at this one as well and see what it can give us so I'm going to take the initial kind of alert bar and give me kind of a heads up if we can get back kind of back above this level here okay so that would be kind of on my watch list at this point but this uh significant volume uh slam down uh manipulation I'm not sure what exactly um happens in in these altcoins we just have to live with it so um I think just keeping an eye on this at the moment I think overall it still looks decent uh it looks like it has a head and shoulders bottom in place so I do like the potential for this to break out if it does break out it has a lot of really what I do like about this if it breaks out it has a lot of upside room because you've got this big move lower that could over time be retraced uh all the way back up you know sort of in a stepping up fashion all the way up to sort of you know 2000 area so it's a good uh double or triple from this point if it can start to get into a new uptrend RLC was a request from somebody this uh overall looks pretty good looks like it has uh quite a few long long wicks suggesting this color of volatility in this although very little volume but overall this does have kind of an august bottom as well double bottom retest December so this looks pretty good I don't know anything about the project I don't even know what the name is all I know is R symbol RLC so I'm giving you a pure chart view only but I do like the fact that we have this big round of bottom and now looks like we have a nice uh sort of uptrend developing and forming here so um if you like the project and you're invested this looks like a nice trend for you to ride the Raven coin um so this one looks like now it actually may have topped finally what a beautiful run that was I would want to say that these two peaks here I'm gonna I'm gonna estimate uh the top sorry the the support now for Raven coin I think this has found a new sort of bottom and drawing this out here I would be a buyer if you're a long-term investor I would be loading up a little more in this area I think this is going to provide some support if it and I think it will get down to this zone uh maybe even breach it a little bit but I think these two kind of points here are going to be important and you know as we as we move forward in the next bull market I think it comes down here and then it starts to make another move higher so this is important I don't see anything from a trading standpoint in the short term though but long term guys watch this area and then buy it in that zone if you like it moving on to stratus here still trending sideways looks like it has a very very wide bottom base here but um not showing a whole lot besides what it did here back in December to convince me that the bottom is definitely in on this one I mean I want to say it is because most of the old coin space seems to have bottoms in place but it still needs to break out we'll probably take some action if we can get a move above this uh alert that I have set um but until that happens I don't see anything that we're going to do at this point so I'm just going to set this alert right there and just see what happens theta here has really broken down I was looking at sort of a a retest maybe like a like a handle here still looks like a cup and a handle although I mean cup and handles typically are continuation patterns you need a lot of history for those I don't know how far back this coin um in terms of trading history goes but does look like a big bottom could be just sort of like a like a handle pull back before going up but I don't trust this pattern I don't like this chart overall don't hate it but don't love it certainly not a trading opportunity from what I can see Tron is a chart that I do like uh still looks like a very very sort of big uh inverse head and shoulders a couple of different uh sort of lows here that one's really not a low so kind of like forms forming one low here one shoulder one here uh December or November lows uh this looks pretty good I think if it can break out of this line I haven't allowed cert that would be a buy then there's room a lot of room higher for maybe getting up to kind of this 0.06 0.07 area up here uh with little resistance uh or at least little resistance to let's say the 0.04 area which is more almost a double uh or 50 move actually kind of all over the place here almost a 50 move from kind of a breakout point around 0.03 could get to 0.04 fairly quickly and then from there potentially all the way up to 0.06 and 7 at that point so this could be a long-term hold at one point if we can get above this area I think if you like this from a long-term perspective you want to kind of want to be buying it here and and expecting at least that this is going to start to move and break up and then move higher over a long period does look like a nice bottoming pattern overall so I do like this chart the vibe is not doing a whole lot here looked like it was gonna kind of start to move higher but it hasn't really done that still trending fairly sideways what I do like about this we have a September low so it made it low a long time ago but I think to get excited about something like this you really want to see uh at least a break of kind of that line there uh that at least puts it into you know a new uh continue I guess uh yeah this puts it into maybe a new uptrend or you know a break of this consolidation that's that's pretty much six or seven months wide at the moment and then could get us up into this other range here and then from there there's plenty of sky and room higher so at this point it's just a hold don't really see a trading opportunity I'm not even sure if I want to be long at this point if I like it long term I'd want to see some evidence that's starting to move higher and it has some momentum behind it VTC was looking good looked like it was moving higher now granted it did get slammed like a lot of them did with bitcoin moving fast but uh I want to see this kind of what I want to see I I would not be trading this long I don't know if I want to be long um from a longer term standpoint as well kind of want to see it get back above this line here to re-establish this uptrend plenty of room high on this one I know this one got slammed uh considerably so plenty of room higher to go but I think it was I think you want to see this at least recapture the 10-day moving average you want to see the 10-day and 20-day moving average pointing back up and moving higher and price to be above that before wanting to get long this again as well so right now definitely an avoid as far as I'm concerned had a request for wax this one is not doing a whole lot kind of in the in the basement as well similar to some of them that haven't really moved yet don't like getting into positions just just for the argument of saying that these will eventually move as well want to see confirmation of a move and this is sort of right at the bottom here if it can move higher and let's just say get above recent highs then what's it it's a potential to look at as well so I'll add an alert on that just to see if we can get back above uh oh I might have alerts okay so 10 I think I have around 30. uh no thanks so let's just keep an eye on this one I think if it want to get let's just say 1700 get above 1700 you want to um you want to be going long perhaps and then that could mean that we'll get above this point here and then we have a nice sort of bowl forming and then we can get back up and make some considerable ground on this one for now it's just a watch keep it on the watch list XLM's not doing a whole lot had some had a little move here but hasn't done much sense I don't like this overall this chart is not looking good everything's moving really well and it's funny because this had a very very good bear market move where it really kept in touch with bitcoin the entire way but since then has really underperformed I don't like anything underperforming especially when the entire market is moving higher this one is moving lower so I want to avoid this and I have no interest in this at all at the moment XMR was promising this is a long term and a short term trade position that I have going on right near the stop again but come back up um seeing if we can recover here looking for this recovery and maybe continue higher I do like this I like it I don't like the short term chart I don't like the fact it came back so sharply but I want to give it a chance to see if it can come back up and move higher at this point maybe a little bias on this one because I do like it long term so it's hard to say but I think it has potential here I think it can move higher again XRP Ripple continues this really long downtrend since altcoins kind of bottomed in December this has just moved lower and lower this will definitely have its day you know it will but I think at the moment we still have some more unresolved price action to the downside to go looks like that that downside action is accelerating here mostly because bitcoin has outperformed as opposed to ripple underperformed I would think but this looks like it could move lower getting down to this level would probably interest me if we can see some type of sign of a reversal in turn I'd be looking at going long something like this but for the time being it's a watch I think eventually see this move here eventually you'll get something like that so just a matter of where it sort of settles and ends before moving higher again Tezos coming back to to earth here but still only back to the 10-day moving average so overall still could be in this uptrend I would say stick with the uptrend if you're long I will use this little cluster here as this is the last real low that we see this is your get out point anything below that is definitely a declining a decline but this point we still could be looking higher want to reverse at this point though you had this bitcoin surge pull this down stabilize kind of a green red a green hammer here could be going higher I think if this gets reversed even if this low of today gets taken out probably an end to this move higher but right now as it stands the structure still still okay and still is moving higher but keep an eye on that overall XVG not loving this looks similar to kind of some ones that haven't made a move yet although we do have a real tightening on the bands here could move could make a nice move higher but I don't want to be positioned waiting for such moves but if you know if you're trading this this is something to watch out for I think any kind of sharp move from here could really move rapidly up but at the same time tight Bollinger bands can can be a move lower right and it's not like we have an established uptrend yet on this one as well even though we have a December low we don't have a sort of a nice upside break to kind of confirm the lows so this is still a watch and be aware the Zcash not doing a whole lot seemed to made it made a bit of a move recently but again I don't like the fact that we have March lows relative under performance overall to bitcoin even under performance to XMR which is kind of its peer companion in the privacy coin space so for me I want to just be avoiding this at the moment not saying it can't move higher probably will if the whole space moves higher but it's not showing me strength so I don't want to be don't be trying to trade the the laggards here I want to be I want to be trading the other ones that are more stronger than the rest of them uh Zend has broken down this is one that I recommended a while ago I know a lot of people jumped on this you would have been out on my last week's recommendation to to raise the stop at this point but now it looks like it hasn't recovered from that bitcoin surge could be a top short-term top here could be coming all the way back down at the moment it is oversold so it could bounce but I don't like the fact that it hasn't pulled back and come back towards recent highs quickly enough and that it's lagging at that point that's a sign of trouble so be aware of that if you're still long this I would be really really cautious and I'd be I'd be cautious about giving back a lot of the profits that you should be in at this point uh take your profits and run and move on and then ZRX this one is a long-term hold again for me but short-term trading wise it got rejected here and it has not recovered I thought that would get a move at least back to kind of this declining trend line and then more of a base so this one has not really shown us any sign which is a little concerning I would have thought that this one would have moved out by now if you know if the alts have bottomed and they're showing a lot of promise this one should have shown promise I'm a little concerned about that even from my long-term holding um I think it will catch a bit eventually but I'm just again I'm a little worried that it hasn't moved so from a trading standpoint nothing to have here and then from a long-term perspective yeah there's some probably some good value here but I'm again a little concerned why it hasn't made that move I would probably wait for an eventual if it does break out of this trend line for getting long on a long-term basis as well okay my friends closing up here a couple of points one bitcoin sorry uh market cap total crypto market cap excluding btc so this is basically everything but bitcoin looking like a bottom december lows are in um this is a very bullish and positive chart for us all but just be aware that a lot of them have already made some moves we could see a a nice little pullback in the short term um and that and we're seeing some signs of weakness in some of the charts overall it's moving higher but just be aware you could get a pullback at any time to the breakout point and then move higher meaning that um if you look at this kind of move here I guess that's 80 billion back down to 60 billion 20 move if all most of these alts could move down 20 a shakeout and then move higher so be aware of that I think in general um everyone's made some good gains in a lot of different alt coins uh excluding maybe some stopouts this last week when bitcoin surged but in general it's been a good couple of months I know my sort of binance account has done really well um but just be aware that it doesn't mean it continues forever you've got to find your opportunities do not um if you have some long term you have your long-term positions do not try and trade wiggles like this you stay long and stay invested but from a trading standpoint just be aware that some of these sellers may begin to fail and that you want to have your stops nice and tight and playing towards the setup that you have identified in terms of risk as well so you don't want to be sort of caught thinking well the market will correct me I'll just stay in a position you may get caught in something like this and and forced to liquidate near the bottom here as well again does not apply to your long-term position and then again just covering bitcoin it kind of in no man's land not much of a uh an opportunity risk reward wise for me from a trading standpoint I remain fully loaded from a long-term perspective and like the fact that we we probably have December lows in place this is this is your weekly lightning report I hope you enjoyed it a lot to cover here it's been a long long morning covering this this report hopefully you'll have a great weekend please provide any questions you have I'll obviously answer them throughout the weekend and then I'll be back on Monday with a full cycles update covering the daily and weekly Bitcoin market thanks very much all the best wishing you a great week you", "source": "episode-2019-04-05"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-03-27?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas, Wednesday morning in New York. hope you're doing really well. so today we have just an update, a midweek update here from the full weekly report that gets published on a Monday. so this one should be fairly brief. but overall, I guess the the most important thing to cover is the fact that we have a decent little reversal here when it looked like we were rolling over into kind of the big window timing band that we have coming up fairly quickly for a cycle low. so this here is a little surprising to me. I did post an alert that I put in that a trade that I entered for short Bitcoin I'm out as of 4,000. it's already at the 40, 20 this morning, probably my my most expensive trade for the year. it's been actually a very good year so far. very few stop stop trades at all, but this one probably is the most stinging for the year. that's just the nature of trading, I guess you know we just have to look back and only you can assess the trades that you make and see if they were the right ones. for me, looking at it today, it's still the right one. we did have a- I think it was a day 34, day 35 sort of peak in here and then started rolling over. then it started accelerating lower- kind of broke. it broke. what trend line was in place at this point? okay, so we broke the trend line, broke below the 20 day moving average. for me, this late in the cycle, that is a short trade candidate. it didn't work out and that's just the nature of trading. we have to live with it. as long as the, as long as you can look back at a trade and still say, yep, it was still okay for me, then that's the right trade. the fact it doesn't work out does not make it a wrong trade. but now what are we looking at here? well, we've got some more strength back in the market. so I think this is telling us that it's just not ready to turn over yet, it's not ready to move lower and it's telling us that we may, even now, with this recent sort of strength on the four hour chart as well, that we may move back over these two candles that we had during the week. kind of get the bulls a little excited again at this point. so, move back over. this level is 40.55. if it gets back over 40.55 it may even accelerate short term to the high side and get up maybe to towards this area here, which the top of this candle was 41.90, so a bit of a range in there. but, um, I think if, if people get excited about it again, it could kind of do this, maybe get up into here and then falter and then begin that move lower, kind of get a little deeper into the timing band for the next cycle low. hard to say, you know, um, but I think the longer this goes sideways, or the longer it goes sideways and higher, the less likely it is that we'll get a massive drop and the less likely it is that we'll drop below the December low, because the reason for that is simply that you need time for decline. even though Bitcoin can, you know, can easily four thousand dollars in a couple of days, there's no question about that- it can make up this ground in a flash. still, the longer it trends sideways and the deeper we get into the 60 day cycle the kind of, the more bullish it becomes overall. um, so that's that's a positive news to take away from this. but overall, I don't go chasing a market like this, not on day 49 of a cycle. I think any move higher here is just I wouldn't call a sucker's rally, it's just late. late, a late cycle type action that, for me, does not interest me and again, I've said this many times before: if we do get a surprise to the upside on the break, I'm not going to necessarily chase that at all. I do have um, obviously my futures account, sitting in BTC, so it's not the end of the world if it goes higher and of course, we all have um. we all should have kind of a cold wallet investment in Bitcoin as well. so not a bad thing to see Bitcoin go higher overall. and even if it's a surprise, some type of surprise cycle, that it just keeps going higher, then again it's. it's not. it's not something that we necessarily be trading, but it's not a bad thing overall. so it's really the downside I want to take advantage of because we are late in the cycle. it's also the downside I want to hedge and protect myself from if we do move lower at this point. another thing this action is probably telling us, and more likely telling us, is that we should never forget. we should zoom out a little bit always. so let's zoom out here and talk about what we've been talking about for a couple of months here is that we're in a crypto winter space, right? so crypto winter. I've talked about the sideways chop for two to three to even four 60 day cycles. so we are trending sideways. we're not trending higher, are we're not trending lower anymore? at least not for now. so in the sideways trending market, we should not be too surprised when we don't see these perfectly arching cycles that occur. just like the last cycle. we really expected it to dip lower and it stopped on day 53. right now, we could be looking at something similar as well, where we could get- I'm just going to draw this in- with a different color, let's go with blue, so we may start to get that. that roll over here kind of just form a low high in this area. so another higher high and then sort of chop again sideways. right, anything is possible at this point in a crypto winter. the idea of a bear market in this point of the cycle is that it frustrates the hell out of everybody and it forces people to start to think about all these alternative scenarios, all these different strategies, because they want to understand the market. people, by nature, want to have an explanation and they want to. they want to just understand what is going on. because if they don't, they just feel lost. and if they don't have a good, plausible sort of bias or understanding what the market might be doing, then it becomes difficult for them to place a trade. and we want to trade. we want to sort of fulfill that need to to be trading. and you know, without kind of a, we had a few squiggly lines in the chart- it makes it difficult to do that and fulfill that need. that's why I try to avoid trading in these types of environments. I don't want to be forcing my view on the market just to fit a trade narrative, just to get a trade on the board. so just be aware of that. in general, we just need to accept the fact that we need to be patient at this point. we need to be patient maybe for another month, maybe you know two or three months, I don't know exactly how long- but we are getting closer and closer. I can definitely assure you that we're getting closer to the point where we start to break out and form a new trend. now I don't think that trend goes to the downside and I've talked about many reasons why I think any move lower, and I mean lower sort of below, kind of these two cycle lows that we've had in the recent past. I think if we do go below those, that's not a new trend lower. it's just a to trap more than anything else. but I think ultimately we do, or we continue to trend sideways and eventually we break higher and eventually we start to build upon cycle after cycle in a very methodical and not so exciting way, but price will tend to go higher over time. we just need to be patient with the market overall. okay, so that's the analysis on bitcoin. not much of an update, except for the fact that we have a little bit of a mini reversal here. that looks good on paper, but when you kind of zoom in it's not a whole lot either. all it's done for the most part is sort of negate the the trend lower that I thought was occurring. so open trade here that is working out really well. is ADA looking, looking fantastic at the moment, took a third profit, looking, taking another third profit soon, getting a little vertical and has and is vertical. I did draw many weeks ago the kind of this, this idea line that I have a trend line that I was looking for potentially for it to occur, and that was fairly aggressive and this is already well and truly sort of more vertical than that that idea. so my only concern is that it does come back to earth. but the nature of this chart looks really good. I think we can get up to this green line, want to take some more profit at that point and then I just want to let a lot of it ride so want to start to move the stops up to even past. so past break, even at this point at the moment, is set below the candle here on March 22nd, which is well above the first entry, but not above the second entry. so we'll be moving up my stops to the second, above the second entry, making the second entry a profitable position and also obviously the first entry, or what's left of the first entry, a very profit, a very profitable position as well, and that's also in a worst case scenario. I'm trying to get to the point where I can move the entire stop, probably below this candle here. that looks like a logical kind of launch period. so it came up, it consolidated a few days and down to this area. but I want to give it a little bit of room still before I do that. I think if we get another candle higher, then that certainly will become the stop. there's no doubt that would become the stop at this point. but again, I just want to give a little bit, a little bit more room. and then the idea: the idea is, if it continues to go higher, then we'll just keep sort of laddering. laddering stops at certain points where it comes back down. but we're not there yet. we need to see another move higher, hoping that we this consolidation here, even though it's only two days, hoping it kind of gives us another one of these, none of these candles. so from here kind of to that- I'm going to copy that- so we get the same width, the same length, and then from there to there. so, yeah, that kind of gets us. it kind of gets us up to that. that 1800 area that I've been talking about as well, where I think we'll probably find some resistance from this move. but again, overall still looks very good. and just be patient, hold your position, don't get, don't get greedy, don't panic. sell. just hold and take profit, as I said before, on some small position so you can ride the rest higher quickly. take a look at a theorem because it is the major um not doing a whole lot and not not as well book bitcoins outperforming this, because this is a bitcoin to ethereum chart. um, so bitcoin has outperformed it, uh, in the last couple of days, so not a whole lot of strength here for this. I don't know where. I keep moving this sideways as it moves sideways, but I still think it's going to break lower into the next cycle: low, um. so overall this is not as bullish as you'd expect. and then even against the dollar, very tight bands here holding kind of this, this, this line here. this line goes back to a prior sort of cycle low during the bull market, so not as significant in short term here has no real bearing, so we can probably just move that out of the way for the moment. but, yeah, overall, um, not a whole lot here. tight bands, uh, but you know again, the cycle low is expected in the in the near future, which means, I think, that the bands resolve themselves lower first. but um, hey, you never know if this, if bitcoin's gonna put in a very flat cycle, this may go very flat, get really really really tight on the bands and then just rocket higher as well. ethereum does have that capability. so just gotta keep an eye on it as well. zrx was. zrx was on my watch list. sorry about that. I just moved my. I just played around with the alert and it went off. but uh, zrx is um, looks like it's kind of formed its bottom here in the short term and it's moving now above the uh the trend line and riding up along the top of the bollinger band. so this here is a potential long for you if you're interested, if it fits your style. um, this kind of point here last few days would be your stopping point. I would think anything below that is certainly an out. but also if you want to get really tight, you can kind of use the 20 day moving average as a um as a guide for potentially getting out if a move is below that. but this looks pretty good. some good strength in here. this could be a good move up to maybe even this trend line here at 9 000. so that would be around about 20 move if it does do that. lastly, I've also posted zen as a trade alert in this section. I think this still looks pretty good. it's consolidated again. I think this can move higher um, but I do. if you are riding this long, you do want to keep it nice and tight. uh, this may be too tight here, but this is kind of, if this is a consolidation after this move up and this, this line I drew last few weeks before that, just indicating that this is how these, this is how these, these coins move. they make a surge higher and then they trend sideways and they make another surge higher. they all have a very similar kind of pattern. so once you see a consolidation period and once you see it move high again, you can move and you should move up your stops to those that cluster, because anything coming back and breaking and violating the bottom of that cluster typically is topped. so I don't know here if this is enough of a move. I think, with the wick up to this area tells me that the cluster here is now the bottom for this little move. so if you have been riding zen higher, I would continue riding and I would just use a nice tight stop. you may want to give it a little breathing room, for example, like maybe three percent below that line, whatever. that is just for some uh, you know, for some some room, uh, for it to move higher. but in general, this is still a nice uptrend and a nice chart. this could, if you let, if you give it time and patient, could make its way all the way up to sort of 2000 and beyond. so I hope you enjoyed that one. just going to finish off here with a look at Litecoin: um, I'm not sure if I've covered this for a little while, but this chart looks great. still, this is a nice looking chart. uh, here's the idea with moves up consolidation, moves up consolidation. so, if anything, we've consolidated nicely, kind of a running higher consolidation as well, which is even more bullish. so I think this can continue higher at this point, can break out of this sort of zone. let's draw it like that and then make a new up, kind of like I could make a new consolidation here and then go again. so this is a nice uptrend. you always want to respect nice long trends like this. you don't want to fight a trend like this. you don't want to try and short a trend like this. you just want to say, uh, I, it's too much, too rich for me, I can't get in right now, or you just want to ride these type of trends, never want to short them. so this looks really good to me. I think this can go higher um, once it breaks, once it can sell that in this area. of course, the only caveat is again that we have a potential cycle low coming up very soon. but then again, the February cycle low did nothing to uh, even though that was a mild cycle low for Bitcoin itself, it did zero to to like on. if anything, it moved higher uh as well. so, uh, that's that's the only risk. the risk, though, I think, is that it comes sort of back into this zone here and then moves higher as well. so that's the update for this week. this is just a midweek update. Friday is the lightning round. that's going to be a pretty lengthy uh 25 to 30 odd coin request. look for that late Friday morning here in New York time, eastern time in the US, and until then, good luck and I'll speak to you soon.", "source": "episode-2019-03-27"}

did have a I think it was a day 34 day 35 sort of peak in here and then started rolling over then it started accelerating lower kind of broke it broke what trend line was in place at this point okay so we broke the trend line broke below the 20 day moving average for me this late in the cycle that is a short trade candidate it didn't work out and that's just the nature of trading we have to live with it as long as the as long as you can look back at a trade and still say yep it was still okay for me then that's the right trade the fact it doesn't work out does not make it a wrong trade but now what are we looking at here well we've got some more strength back in the market so I think this is telling us that it's just not ready to turn over yet it's not ready to move lower and it's telling us that we may even now with this recent sort of strength on the four hour chart as well that we may move back over these two candles that we had during the week kind of get the bulls a little excited again at this point so move back over this level is 40.55 if it gets back over 40.55 it may even accelerate short term to the high side and get up maybe to towards this area here which the top of this candle was 41.90 so a bit of a range in there but um I think if if people get excited about it again it could kind of do this maybe get up into here and then falter and then begin that move lower kind of get a little deeper into the timing band for the next cycle low hard to say you know um but I think the longer this goes sideways or the longer it goes sideways and higher the less likely it is that we'll get a massive drop and the less likely it is that we'll drop below the December low because the reason for that is simply that you need time for decline even though Bitcoin can you know can easily four thousand dollars in a couple of days there's no question about that it can make up this ground in a flash still the longer it trends sideways and the deeper we get into the 60 day cycle the kind of the more bullish it becomes overall um so that's that's a positive news to take away from this but overall I don't go chasing a market like this not on day 49 of a cycle I think any move higher here is just I wouldn't call a sucker's rally it's just late late a late cycle type action that for me does not interest me and again I've said this many times before if we do get a surprise to the upside on the break I'm not going to necessarily chase that at all I do have um obviously my futures account sitting in BTC so it's not the end of the world if it goes higher and of course we all have um we all should have kind of a cold wallet investment in Bitcoin as well so not a bad thing to see Bitcoin go higher overall and even if it's a surprise some type of surprise cycle that it just keeps going higher then again it's it's not it's not something that we necessarily be trading but it's not a bad thing overall so it's really the downside I want to take advantage of because we are late in the cycle it's also the downside I want to hedge and protect myself from if we do move lower at this point another thing this action is probably telling us and more likely telling us is that we should never forget we should zoom out a little bit always so let's zoom out here and talk about what we've been talking about for a couple of months here is that we're in a crypto winter space right so crypto winter I've talked about the sideways chop for two to three to even four 60 day cycles so we are trending sideways we're not trending higher are we're not trending lower anymore at least not for now so in the sideways trending market we should not be too surprised when we don't see these perfectly arching cycles that occur just like the last cycle we really expected it to dip lower and it stopped on day 53 right now we could be looking at something similar as well where we could get I'm just going to draw this in with a different color let's go with blue so we may start to get that that roll over here kind of just form a low high in this area so another higher high and then sort of chop again sideways right anything is possible at this point in a crypto winter the idea of a bear market in this point of the cycle is that it frustrates the hell out of everybody and it forces people to start to think about all these alternative scenarios all these different strategies because they want to understand the market people by nature want to have an explanation and they want to they want to just understand what is going on because if they don't they just feel lost and if they don't have a good plausible sort of bias or understanding what the market might be doing then it becomes difficult for them to place a trade and we want to trade we want to sort of fulfill that need to to be trading and you know without kind of a we had a few squiggly lines in the chart it makes it difficult to do that and fulfill that need that's why I try to avoid trading in these types of environments I don't want to be forcing my view on the market just to fit a trade narrative just to get a trade on the board so just be aware of that in general we just need to accept the fact that we need to be patient at this point we need to be patient maybe for another month maybe you know two or three months I don't know exactly how long but we are getting closer and closer I can definitely assure you that we're getting closer to the point where we start to break out and form a new trend now I don't think that trend goes to the downside and I've talked about many reasons why I think any move lower and I mean lower sort of below kind of these two cycle lows that we've had in the recent past I think if we do go below those that's not a new trend lower it's just a to trap more than anything else but I think ultimately we do or we continue to trend sideways and eventually we break higher and eventually we start to build upon cycle after cycle in a very methodical and not so exciting way but price will tend to go higher over time we just need to be patient with the market overall okay so that's the analysis on bitcoin not much of an update except for the fact that we have a little bit of a mini reversal here that looks good on paper but when you kind of zoom in it's not a whole lot either all it's done for the most part is sort of negate the the trend lower that I thought was occurring so open trade here that is working out really well is ADA looking looking fantastic at the moment took a third profit looking taking another third profit soon getting a little vertical and has and is vertical I did draw many weeks ago the kind of this this idea line that I have a trend line that I was looking for potentially for it to occur and that was fairly aggressive and this is already well and truly sort of more vertical than that that idea so my only concern is that it does come back to earth but the nature of this chart looks really good I think we can get up to this green line want to take some more profit at that point and then I just want to let a lot of it ride so want to start to move the stops up to even past so past break even at this point at the moment is set below the candle here on March 22nd which is well above the first entry but not above the second entry so we'll be moving up my stops to the second above the second entry making the second entry a profitable position and also obviously the first entry or what's left of the first entry a very profit a very profitable position as well and that's also in a worst case scenario I'm trying to get to the point where I can move the entire stop probably below this candle here that looks like a logical kind of launch period so it came up it consolidated a few days and down to this area but I want to give it a little bit of room still before I do that I think if we get another candle higher then that certainly will become the stop there's no doubt that would become the stop at this point but again I just want to give a little bit a little bit more room and then the idea the idea is if it continues to go higher then we'll just keep sort of laddering laddering stops at certain points where it comes back down but we're not there yet we need to see another move higher hoping that we this consolidation here even though it's only two days hoping it kind of gives us another one of these none of these candles so from here kind of to that I'm going to copy that so we get the same width the same length and then from there to there so yeah that kind of gets us it kind of gets us up to that that 1800 area that I've been talking about as well where I think we'll probably find some resistance from this move but again overall still looks very good and just be patient hold your position don't get don't get greedy don't panic sell just hold and take profit as I said before on some small position so you can ride the rest higher quickly take a look at a theorem because it is the major um not doing a whole lot and not not as well book bitcoins outperforming this because this is a bitcoin to ethereum chart um so bitcoin has outperformed it uh in the last couple of days so not a whole lot of strength here for this I don't know where I keep moving this sideways as it moves sideways but I still think it's going to break lower into the next cycle low um so overall this is not as bullish as you'd expect and then even against the dollar very tight bands here holding kind of this this this line here this line goes back to a prior sort of cycle low during the bull market so not as significant in short term here has no real bearing so we can probably just move that out of the way for the moment but yeah overall um not a whole lot here tight bands uh but you know again the cycle low is expected in the in the near future which means I think that the bands resolve themselves lower first but um hey you never know if this if bitcoin's gonna put in a very flat cycle this may go very flat get really really really tight on the bands and then just rocket higher as well ethereum does have that capability so just gotta keep an eye on it as well zrx was zrx was on my watch list sorry about that I just moved my I just played around with the alert and it went off but uh zrx is um looks like it's kind of formed its bottom here in the short term and it's moving now above the uh the trend line and riding up along the top of the bollinger band so this here is a potential long for you if you're interested if it fits your style um this kind of point here last few days would be your stopping point I would think anything below that is certainly an out but also if you want to get really tight you can kind of use the 20 day moving average as a um as a guide for potentially getting out if a move is below that but this looks pretty good some good strength in here this could be a good move up to maybe even this trend line here at 9 000 so that would be around about 20 move if it does do that lastly I've also posted zen as a trade alert in this section I think this still looks pretty good it's consolidated again I think this can move higher um but I do if you are riding this long you do want to keep it nice and tight uh this may be too tight here but this is kind of if this is a consolidation after this move up and this this line I drew last few weeks before that just indicating that this is how these this is how these these coins move they make a surge higher and then they trend sideways and they make another surge higher they all have a very similar kind of pattern so once you see a consolidation period and once you see it move high again you can move and you should move up your stops to those that cluster because anything coming back and breaking and violating the bottom of that cluster typically is topped so I don't know here if this is enough of a move I think with the wick up to this area tells me that the cluster here is now the bottom for this little move so if you have been riding zen higher I would continue riding and I would just use a nice tight stop you may want to give it a little breathing room for example like maybe three percent below that line whatever that is just for some uh you know for some some room uh for it to move higher but in general this is still a nice uptrend and a nice chart this could if you let if you give it time and patient could make its way all the way up to sort of 2000 and beyond so I hope you enjoyed that one just going to finish off here with a look at Litecoin um I'm not sure if I've covered this for a little while but this chart looks great still this is a nice looking chart uh here's the idea with moves up consolidation moves up consolidation so if anything we've consolidated nicely kind of a running higher consolidation as well which is even more bullish so I think this can continue higher at this point can break out of this sort of zone let's draw it like that and then make a new up kind of like I could make a new consolidation here and then go again so this is a nice uptrend you always want to respect nice long trends like this you don't want to fight a trend like this you don't want to try and short a trend like this you just want to say uh I it's too much too rich for me I can't get in right now or you just want to ride these type of trends never want to short them so this looks really good to me I think this can go higher um once it breaks once it can sell that in this area of course the only caveat is again that we have a potential cycle low coming up very soon but then again the February cycle low did nothing to uh even though that was a mild cycle low for Bitcoin itself it did zero to to like on if anything it moved higher uh as well so uh that's that's the only risk the risk though I think is that it comes sort of back into this zone here and then moves higher as well so that's the update for this week this is just a midweek update Friday is the lightning round that's going to be a pretty lengthy uh 25 to 30 odd coin request look for that late Friday morning here in New York time eastern time in the U.S. and until then good luck and I'll speak to you soon", "source": "episode-2019-03-27"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-26?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members. that's Bob Lucas, Friday morning in New York. I hope you're doing really well, looking forward to the weekend. so here is the newly new format for the lightning report. this week I'm not going to go over 30 odd coins where I think most of you are not really paying attention to some of the most of these coins. the format has changed as of Wednesday. Wednesday becomes a top 10 market cap report- all the top 10 coins reviewed in a little more detail, both short term and long term. then the Friday's report becomes the top 10 altcoins requested by you, the members. that way, I'm only covering coins that I know people are interested in or requested, and that will be done via the comments on the Wednesday's top 10 report. you can then put in a request for the Friday report and, by the looks of it, there were six requests for different coins I'm going to cover today. so I'm going to cover six of those coins. I'm also going to cover Bitcoin, as I always do, and then I'm going to look through my list, see if there's anything else I find of interest that you may want to put on your own watch list. so let's go into Bitcoin. all right, so we had some pretty significant tether news from the New York Attorney General suing, or you know- basically stating that Bitfinex used a whole lot of tether reserves to cover losses that they had in the Bitfinex exchange. not, they're not suggesting this time that they are creating tether out of thin air or that it's not backed, but that they used funds essentially from tether to cover losses. so, in the end, probably not the most horrible news, I guess, and also, at the moment, still something that Bitfinex is going to reply to and it's not substantiated at this point. so, regardless of what happened, it did cause a 10% decline in Bitcoin. I'm not sure if that news warranted such a decline. to be honest with you, I think what we have more here is we had a tightening of the Bollinger Bands, we had a lot less volatility and then the news driven event expanded that and created a cascading effect of declines. now I did warn in an alert yesterday that we could be looking at the daily cycle top or the 60 day cycle top for this. for Bitcoin, it is possible that would be around about day 30 high. not too bad, considering we've been seeing shorter highs- 18 and 9 and 27. we haven't had a 19. let's go back day 30 high. last time we had one in a cycle was back in July. so even even if it topped right here- probably not the end of the world, probably still looking at a retracement in that case- sort of down like that right and into the next cycle low end of May- that's not too bad, that's. that's within my expectation, still. so this is the. this is kind of- I wouldn't call the primary thesis that I have right now for where Bitcoin stands, but something to certainly be aware of, because we are below the 10 day moving average and the 20 day moving average, and whenever that happens around the midpoint or the latter half of a cycle, you really need to be careful and consider the fact that it may have topped already now. that being said, let's see how it responds over the next two days in the weekend. if it bounces back from this point and rallies back over the 10 and 20 day moving average- let's just say back of 53.50, for example- then you know we could be looking at another leg higher, and that would be very bullish. I think that would be very bull market like behavior as well, so let's just look out for that. at this point, though, there's no point in trying to front run or trying to trade any one of these scenarios because it is kind of 50: 50 right. so if we get back above, we could do this one more high around early May, get up to that sort of 5800 area I've been talking about for a while, which is the resistance, which was the support, but which should become resistance from the bear market 2018 period and then come back down. in this case, similar type of action. I expect it'll come back down into this May cycle: low, maybe a little higher because it's higher, coming from a higher spot. hard to say, but in the in the end, kind of the same net result that I'm looking for, regardless of what we're doing here in the short term. so that's kind of how I see this market at the moment. there always is the possibility that we even get even steeper. of course, just be aware of this. again, it doesn't really matter hodlers, long-term guys, we have our positions right, we're set at this point. that doesn't worry us. we just we can maybe buy some more. if it gets down to that area traders, then if it breaks down sharply, if it breaks below yesterday's lows and if it breaks below April 12th lows right here around 4900, then we have probably going to have a run on Bitcoin and obviously a top in place. so we can look for a short, but not until we get below 49, 48, 50, 48, 80, that type of area. that's the only time we start looking for a short. then we know we're well below the 10-day moving average. we know we have a cycle top. we'll be riding the lower Bollinger Bands at that point, then we'll be in a short-term downtrend. then we can look to sure. at the moment there is no clear-cut path here for risking a lot of capital and therefore we are in a wait-and-see type of mode. okay, so that's the analysis for Bitcoin. so a little bit of a change since during the week where I was looking at this uptrend. now this uptrend for now at the moment is temporarily broken. be aware of that. that's a trend changer. potentially again just play defense right now. no, no point in trying to swing at something here that's very difficult to hit. okay, first request is: bat basic attention token looking good still. chart looks beautiful, still a nice. rising 20-day moving average. 10-day fairly, fairly well above price. still at the 10-day moving average. we have kind of up, down, up, down, up. so nice rising, step up type of trend back at this area here, which is sort of the highs from early April now back down becoming lows and testing that area. I don't know if you want to be trading the alts right now- this is the only problem. but if you're going to be trading anything or if you're going to be holding anything, right now bat is one of the strongest and this is this is the one you want to be holding. okay, so this one here looks like it's still going to continue higher. hard to say, though. we still have a little bit of rollover in some of the technicals. but again, if you bought this or bought the breakout, hold it. do not sell this right now. this still looks pretty good, I think, if it stays kind of while the price stays above this 10 and 20-day moving average. I like to hold charts like this and keep going with it. so nothing horrible about this. this is probably one of the best looking charts and even when you extend long term out, you see that it's clearly spent a year or so in this, in this triangle here broken out now and showing some real good strength. obviously, bat has some some news as well with the enablement of being able to now tip and compensate more content providers and so forth. so they've expanded on their, their technology and delivered towards their roadmap. I think this is also fueling a lot of this move. so some of this may already be priced in. some of this may eventually come and retrace back to the breakout point, something to be aware of as well. could go either way in that sense. but overall, a good looking chart and this is definitely a maintain a position, or add on pullbacks as well, all right. raven coin seems to be a fan favorite, but it is breaking down. we- I covered this in last week's lining report. I put this line in here. it's kind of like a get out. right now. this is breaking down. this is in the downtrend. there's no doubt about that at all. a downtrend has been established: high, a low, a high tested, tested. those lows came back up, didn't make a new high, came back down, made new lows. this now is in the downtrend. this is an avoid. I would not be trying to pick a bottom right here. the next place you can pick a bottom- it's actually not that far away now- a 10 percent lower. but I think this point here is significant. it is kind of when it first listed on Binance like a week in back in October. then we had this move in March to test, came back down and then broke out with significant sort of you know style came back down. now I think if it retests this breakout point, kind of at the 900 area, could be an opportunity to get long if it can reverse. so what we look for is not just a touch to buy- I don't think that gives you much- but if we can get down and touch that line and then come back up and reverse, then what you can do is you can buy kind of this area here and then use the breakout with a little bit of cushion as your stop as well. so we're looking for a retest of this breakout point and then it can then maybe go higher again and start a new uptrend as well, like this. that would be the goal. long-term holders, I think you want to still hold this. this is not not an unusual kind of pullback. it did, obviously. I mean it's come from you know: 250, 300 Satoshi, up to 1700. that's a massive move. so this type of longer term retracement is not unusual when you see a pattern like this. next request is for hot or hollow- uh, 25 Satoshi here. this is a micro, micro cap not doing anything I like at the moment. this looked like a big consolation, uh, sort of a big pennant almost, um, but now more of a triangle it's breaking down. so, uh, where do you put this line? it looks like it should be somewhere like that: broken down, 25 Satoshi. I think this is heading back down to this sort of 20 or 20 or 15 area. in my opinion, don't look at, don't, don't like anything about this chart, to be perfectly honest with you, unless it can come back and break this line here, um, the downtrend line here. that's the only time there's anything positive to to be had in this type of chart. next chart on the list is vet: um, this one here is coming back now pretty sharply, uh, like many of the altcoins showing at the moment. so we had this big base that was good, starting to come out. didn't really do a whole lot, although in percentage terms not too bad, but this type of weakness we're seeing here on significant separation with the moving averages is showing a pretty significant downtrend here. this is an avoid until these can find a new low kind of break, um, not that it's a defined uh downtrend like that, but until it can kind of show a new pattern, maybe show a low, a high and then a new higher high and a higher low and a higher high, so show us that's broken the trend. there's really nothing to have here. otherwise you just kind of, you know, try to catch a falling knife, so to speak. but right now it's much closer to the lows of december and january and february than it is anything else and for that reason i think we are going to probably bottom test all these areas here before it does anything. so at the moment, again, this one is also an avoid the doge coin, a fan favorite for sure, but not looking good right now. lost all the support from uh december, january and february. had a nice move recently, of course, but now it's below that. so let's just look at a couple of important points here. this sort of area, here it's lost the november lows it is testing, and then there are further lows before that. so, yeah, this one kind of has its own. you know, this one here is a candidate for in the future doing some cycle work on, because it has a very distinct community behind it and a very established community. so i'm pretty sure if i dug deep into this one, this could probably have some type of their own cycle pattern going and it looks kind of cyclical as well. if you look at these kind of sharp troughs and peaks that it's showing here, you know it possibly has something going there now long term wise, i think you know. so there's no, there's no short-term trade from the moment, unless it can kind of reverse and start maybe getting back about. let me zoom back in, get back above kind of this area here at 50 and keep going. but if it gets down to this sort of 36 level, i think this is a long-term buy and hold for sure, because it has shown the ability to get up up into this 100- 115 area, which i think it will again at some point. this, this coin, is not going anywhere. it hasn't established history. so long-term holders, not a bad point even right now to get in at this one, but definitely if it gets down to 36 or so, for traders you think you want to look for a reversal and a swing before looking to get long. so here's another request: um covalent, never heard of it, never seen this chart before. very first time looks, uh, relatively new, at least on this exchange. didn't see many other exchange options for it. um, not too bad. i mean it started off here at a pretty high point, so it's down 50 or 60 percent, like a lot of them do when they newly list. um looks to form kind of a bottom here. now it's coming back up, retesting. you know i, i don't know, i don't know enough about this to give an honest opinion. overall it looks like a media star to break, to break down. i think it has to recover this 10 and 20 day moving average and continue this trend so kind of put in the bottom almost right here and establish sort of a new trend like that. if it can do that and get back above, you can probably buy that and go along again. from a trade standpoint- just a trading standpoint- i don't see any edge just looking at this chart to get long. nothing strikes me as an opportunity for the person that requested this. if they like the tech looking a long term, that doesn't look too bad. it looks like it's sort of found the bottom here. it's come back a little bit. not a bad spot to get in, not a point to panic, that's for sure. so this overall doesn't look too bad from that perspective. okay, zen is one of my picks. looking through my list, this one here looks uh interesting. not a buy yet, but has some good volume and good price strength today. i think if this here remains the bottom, get it back above the 10 day moving average. here we could be looking at a long opportunity. so, uh, nice, good sort of comeback off a nice uptrend. if it can re-establish that, it's a possible trade idea, take a look at that and put on your watch list. take a look at the altcoin market cap. uh, good breakout coming back lower. this looks similar to a lot of the charts could be looking at now a balance off the initial breakout point, which would be positive. we could be looking at a continuation, especially if bitcoin has topped. it's possible that alts can at least hold their ground, not necessarily rally, uh against sort of like the usd, but at least maybe uh outperform bitcoin in the coming, and that would be very bullish, because in the bear market, when bitcoin dropped, all coins got crushed, and so in the bear market, in the bull market, when bitcoin drops, the altcoins can outperform. not saying it's going to happen, but it's possible here that we're looking at kind of like a bounce now or maybe a near bottom. you never know, it could be looking at something like this as well. that would be very bullish if we do get something like this and that would be very much confirmation that the bull market is back in, because alt have now established a new uptrend as well. but it's hard to say. bitcoin dominance went pretty high very recently, so it's a matter of just wait and see. but this is where we want to see a lot of the bleeding stop in the altcoin space, kind of in this area now the next couple of weeks. otherwise it threatens to break back down, market cap get below kind of the breakout point and then you really don't know what what you're dealing with. but we do have to watch out. you know we do have a lot of charts that are completely broken down. look at xmr to to um, you know monero to btc- where i thought it was going to be a nice breakout from a triangle. it's now reverse and making new lows. not very good, uh, look at this one: go chain making new lows, nice surge high. i got everybody excited. now making new lows. zrx looking- uh, looking like it might break down and making new lows as well. you know, zil, breaking down new lows, key self key. breaking down new lows. mkr was a good chart for a while. there completely lost it. now, uh, giving back 50, 60 percent. these are brutal. these, these all coins, i mean they can make you a lot of btc, a lot of usd, but, man, if you hold them for too long and if you don't get out and take your profit, you're going to get crushed. and this is the lesson, and- and this should be the lesson for the next altcoin run and the one after that, because it's going to be quite a few of them- too many people make good money and they end up actually losing more than they made because they feel as if they get addicted to the gains and it's very difficult to divorce yourself emotionally from the gains. and people go looking for more and more gains. they keep buying the dips, they keep buying the drops, thinking that's going to continue, like it did for them in the earlier part of the rally, and of course it doesn't. and then, once they get into a very sort of negative position, it's hard for them to close it out because it's in a lost position and they don't want to show a loss, for whatever reason, on their um. you know on their account. so this is just another example that a good looking chart that everybody's talking about doing really well and now doing horribly. don't hold stuff like this. cut your losses early. put your stop losses in um. you know it's okay to be wrong. you're only. you're only. you're only gonna hold yourself accountable. you're the only one in the end that's gonna judge um and you're the only one that's gonna look at your own performance, and your win-loss ratio is meaningless. the count balance is what matters in the end. so just be aware of that. okay, all the best. that's the lightning report for today. hope you have a great weekend and i'll come out on monday with the next version of the bitcoin cycles report. all the best to you.", "source": "episode-2019-04-26"}

Hope you're doing really well and looking forward to your weekend. I'm feeling a little under the weather this morning so my voice is probably going to be coming in and out somewhat. But today is the lightning report. I'm going to cover over 30 coins. The list seems to be getting longer each week, so these reports are taking longer and longer Again. the disclaimer here is that my primary focus is in Bitcoin and the Bitcoin cycles. The altcoins are for trading when I see a favorable setup, Something that looks like could move higher or has a nice trend to it. I want to point that out Again. the other disclaimer is that a lot of these I'm looking at for the first time, or I'm looking at them for the first time in a week since the last report. So you know, like anything in trading, it's best to be more familiar with the way a particular asset or coin trades. Normally, each sort of asset has its own little flavor in how it sort of moves and oscillates on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis, So I'm not privy to a lot of that information. I'm looking at a lot of these charts purely in sort of a very fresh look and giving an opinion very rapidly on that, And for that point you really got to take what I say with a grain of salt and use it more just to complement whatever research or whatever you're looking at and seeing, and maybe if it kind of gels with what you're seeing or if it fits with your strategy, then maybe that helps. But otherwise I don't encourage anybody so just jumping all over something that I particularly say. Now, if there's something I really like from a trade standpoint, I'm going to trade it myself and I'm going to make an alert in that case. That's when you know I'm, at least as far as I'm personally concerned, vested and taking on my own risk. So maybe that those types of situations you can take maybe a little more seriously, Okay, so that being said, of course we'll start off with Bitcoin, as we always do, and you know at the moment we're seeing a little bit of a pullback: two, three day pullback. I think this is very healthy and very normal. We obviously had a big surge coming out of the- you know, the wedge or triangle pattern here. Overall, the trend is up. The trend is up on the daily chart. We have at least at least one full cycle high that is higher than the well, actually even to the last one, but we have at least one cycle low that is higher than the other one. But I think we have two cycle lows that are higher than the prior ones. So we definitely have a step up on the lows and we have at least one cycle high somewhere. wherever this ends up being, whether it's here or whether it's further out, it's going to be at least one cycle higher, higher than the other two. So that's just the definition of a trend, an uptrend. It may not be a solid uptrend, but regardless, the fact is, December is the last major low, So we have to respect the fact that we're released in. we're at least in some type of uptrend, and we're seeing the same in the altcoin space. We are seeing many of the charts show us. some have already broken out, of course, and doing really well, like Litecoin and others, but the rest of them seem to have rounded bottoms and are showing uptrends at the moment. So we need to shift our bias somewhat to be a little more bullish. I'm not saying we should not be uber bullish at this point. We are still in this sideways chopping market as far as I'm concerned. but we're not in the savage bear market either where we want to be very hesitant to take trades or to be taking profit very rapidly. So just always- I like to point that out in the beginning because when I approach my trading and approach my chart analysis, I like to think of what the, the overall trend is telling me and that kind of sets a little bit of my bias or sets my thinking and how accommodating I want to be when it comes to some of the analysis or some of the setups that I may be looking at. So for Bitcoin, again pulled back back to the 10-day moving average, slightly below that. Overall, I like this chart. Can it go lower? I think it can go down to the 20-day moving average. I think if it gets down, to say, to this sort of point, that's probably even- you know, maybe- a healthy buy at this point and then we can maybe make another move up and possibly test that 5800 level area later in the cycle, later in the month. and if we can get a test up in that area later in the month, what it does is at least puts us at a point where we're topping in the cycle later on. I mean, we had some early tops, even though the cycles were short. These are both left translated but with higher lows, So a mixed bag. overall. It seems like we have a lot of selling pressure along with a lot of buying support here, creating this sort of crunch that we see in the Bollinger Bands and crunch in the sort of triangle pattern. That's just the nature of people selling in to lower prices, thinking I think it's going to go lower, and also the accumulation that we're seeing from the sidelines in Bitcoin. So we're seeing a lot of that. This now has escaped higher, I think, and I want to see- I want to see the cycle form a top- hopefully late April, even into May would be nice- maybe form right translated and stay in this sort of zone here, above the prior two highs that we have for cycle highs and uh below the 6800- 5800 level. I think that sets up the scene for more accumulation and more of this uptrend and then, you know, later by the summer maybe looking at sort of breaking out of that zone and coming up higher. And you see something similar on the weekly chart. here's the, here's the weekly good volume coming in more recently: uh, seven straight weeks of green candle. so it's not unlikely or unusual to see a red candle come in, maybe even two. we may inform, uh, sort of a three week consolidation, um, you know, sort of like a a flag here, um, on the weekly chart as well, that's possible. I mean, you know, we have to wait a few more weeks, of course, but something like that before moving higher and that puts us in, that that can create the right translated cycle that we, that we want to see at this point. we haven't seen a right translated cycle in many, many cycles. but right here, filling in this gap. see, there's very little fill in here, it's just this one big bar coming down and then, most of the all, the action is below, you know, below this 4200 area. so filling in this gap here for maybe one or two cycles would be ideal before taking a few cracks at this heavy resistance area. that will, I think, will provide a lot of resistance for most of the year. okay, so that's the bitcoin analysis. from a trade standpoint, I don't see anything right now, um, because it's not such a clean setup, but you know, you've got a couple of candles down here around the 4700 area. if we get a little further down, we may be able to consider taking some type of a long trade and then using maybe those candles or something like that. it's not very clean, but I do like to pull back. I mean I don't want to short any of this. it's too early in the cycle and this looks like just a controlled pullback and consolidation here and nothing more sinister than that on the four hour chart. you know, you kind of see it rolling over here. if we can kind of roll back down into this sort of 47- 4800 area, uh, maybe an opportunity, but for now I mean, I'm sure traders can find an opportunity here, but for me I'm just going to sit the sidelines, wait it out and look for something more obvious before wanting to get long. what I do like, and I'm going to switch over to ethereum right now. so ethereum dollar is still a position I hold. um, I still like this chart here. it's got to be honest with you, even though it's sort of come back. we had a little bit of a breakout. it's come back. it's retested and dropped slightly below the breakout point, back below the 10 day moving average, which I don't like, but still above the 20.. so if as long as it stays above the 20 um and and that 20 right now is at um. what is it? it's at 150. actually it's 156, which is where my stop is as well. so, um, right here is where my stop- 156.. so I still like this position here. I can hopefully see it rally back up now that's that sort of retest and spend some time here. so this is what I see on ethereum versus the dollar still position that I hold. if you didn't get in, it still offers a decent uh risk reward here I think the reward is potential is, uh, all the way up sort of in the in a 230- 240 range um, and then the risk, of course, at the moment is around about 10 dollars uh for each ethereum down to 156. so it's a decent opportunity. the chart still looks good as far as I'm concerned. ethereum btc is holding up, hasn't done anything, but it hasn't dropped either. um, looking like nice sort of bottoming pattern as well. so this one has the opportunity to break higher. hasn't made any real moves, so nothing I like significantly on this chart. but um, you know like I like the ethereum versus dollar more than anything else. uh, just playing around with some something. yeah, I would need a break sort of higher this area to kind of kind of convince me that we have a bottom in here, bottom in play and then a move higher. so I'm sticking more with ethereum versus the dollar. all right, now let's get into the main list of coins. now let me be clear on something. a lot of these coins, uh, have a decent reversal or decent sell-off over the last week, so there's been a good sell-off. the ones that did not show breakouts and positive uptrends did not look good. I'm going to skip over. I'm going to cover them, but just going to the analysis is going to be very brief. don't want to be, I don't want to be in a coin or trading something that didn't break out, that didn't have relative strength, that's not showing me a nice chart pattern- like ada is right here, because I want to buy pullbacks for coins that are in an uptrend. I don't want to be buying stuff that didn't break out, the only forms that seem to be forming around the bottom but it's since not broken out and actually come back near the lows. there's quite a few of those types of charts and those are the ones you want to avoid. I know there's a tendency for people to think, oh, there's value there that hasn't made a move yet. if I just buy it, it's going to make a move. no, that's a trap. yeah, some of them may make moves, but a lot of them may easily make new lows as well. I think you want to be buying the strength. you want to be buying the charts, like this one here that looks good. that is showing us a pullback. so this one here looks really good. um, I mean, I'm long this one. still, I'm holding this long the initial pattern I drew back in March, over a month ago. it's pretty much playing out. we have a nice pullback right here. I think this is a buy you could use, if you know. if you want to trade this, you could. I think you can use a couple of these wicks here as your stop. so around about the 1500 level, 1500 satoshi- this looks like it's pulled back. if it's going to continue the uptrend, then this might be the extent of the sell-off. so ADA to me looks really good. I'm holding my last position for at least this 2400 area, but maybe even this sort of 3000 area is my target on that. so ARK fits in the middle of those two uptrend versus hasn't broken out type of coins I mentioned. this one does have a breakout, but not a solid uptrend, and we do have a good pullback all the way, kind of to. I wouldn't really call it a neckline, but at least this line here where we did see a few of the tops before breaking out. so overall this isn't a bad chart. this is a good pullback, I think. if it consists, if the whole altcoin space could find a low right at this point, this one has some good potential. so if you've been following, this one has potential as well. definitely, back to this point is is positive and we could could rally up from here. air swap is a horrible looking chart. it has exactly what I said before: around the bottom without breaking higher, and now it's breaking lower. so this one for me is definitely an avoid. okay, bat is one of one chart that I actually like more from a long-term standpoint. this one broke out last week just going to sort of put something here, not exactly perfectly touching, but you can see. you know repeated attempts in this area and then another one right here and then a good solid move and now back down. so I don't know anything about the tech, but if you like the tech, this is a good looking chart. in my opinion it's almost like kind of like a wedge as well, so you've got to go that. I think this looks good. it's broken out, come back retested. this is a good entry here for the long-term play. not sure from a trade standpoint what I see here, if I don't see, if I see anything but this one I like from a long term. this is a very pretty looking chart, long term wise. Bitcoin Cash: ABC: nice move up, another move up, consolidating, I think, as long as it's above the 20-day moving average here. this is a good looking chart and stick with the trend. you can buy this area here. maybe use these two stops, these two wicks, the bottoms of the lows of these, as your stop point. but this does look like good chart. it seems like it's at least in an uptrend. um, and yeah, this is, uh, this is a probably a bit of buy right now. if you're holding, if you bought this and you're holding, definitely stay, stay with it, stick with it. and then somebody asked about um in in the comments section about Bitcoin Cash versus the dollar. similar looking chart here, actually maybe a little, a little prettier as well, because we had this good move above the Bollinger Bands. now it's coming back again. stay long on this one. this one does look good. um, I think your exit is probably below the 20 and on a closing basis or something like that, but, um, you know it's had a double already, so that's you know. so you definitely be taking some profit if you got in sort of in this area down here. don't want to be, uh, riding your entire move here. take some profits already doubled, but this one has potential to maybe even get up to sort of the 350 400 range fairly easily and even more, because it does have a lot of room higher, uh, at least up to like the 490 500 area. and I think also this is probably catching a bit because bitcoin sv has not been doing well. it's, it's negative in the news and, and being that that was a fork and bitcoin abc exists because of that fork, then it's very likely that some of the value is getting transferred over as well. yeah, sv, as I said last week, looks horrible. don't like anything about this chart. hasn't done anything. I would have thought it would have had some type of rally with bitcoin abc or bitcoin cash. it has not and, like I said earlier. again, there's a lot of negative press around craig wright and sort of the whole organization in general, so this does not look positive. I would avoid this finance coin to me now looks like I'm out topped. we have a cross of the 10 with the 20 day moving average, so that's the first sign we are touching the lower bollinger bands, not just once, but twice. I don't. I don't mind a touch the lower bollinger bands in an uptrend. that's generally a good buying signal. but this is done in a couple times now and now seems to be hugging the bottom bollinger bands, which means it's now trending that way as opposed to just being over oversold. so for me this now is a sell or avoid. if you rode most of this, I think it's time to start seriously considering taking a lot of the profit, keeping some if you like it from a long-term standpoint. but it's had a major run and people made a lot of money in this. so I think you've got to be cautious here that if profit taking release begins, then it could get much worse. and then also you can look at kind of this low here exceeded that low here. you would have thought that bounce off that area. so to me it looks like now we have the makings of a new trend lower. so just be cautious and be be aware of that if you're in binance coin. bit shares kind of had a breakout, although it's a. you know I don't trust bigger weeks like this on on lightly traded coins, but I wouldn't call this a nice uptrend. yet this is kind of a rounded bottom and I don't like the fact that we really pierced the lower bollinger band here. I think we could be trending lower again. this one, um, doesn't look like a nice pullback in an uptrend as far as I'm concerned. it just looks too severe for me, so I would avoid this one. exactly the same type of thing on civic coin that we have on bit shares. exactly the same analysis: just too much of a downtrend, too much of a pullback, even more so for civic coin. so this one for me, is not a good looking chart. I would definitely avoid this. dash, on the other hand, is in an uptrend. it has this step up, step up, step up. so I think why, as long as this prior low holds, it is an opportunity to possibly get long again. you, if you get long for a trade, the the uptrend is still in play. we do have a clear higher highs and higher low structure here. this pullback is significant and healthy. so if you want to get long for the intermediate sort of time frame, you could, I think, and then definitely use this as your stop. at the moment, which isn't too far lower, I think this could continue the structure. if, certainly if all coins are going to get another bid in the next sort of few days or week, then this one looks like it certainly would participate and kind of make that move higher again and make another higher high before coming back down and forming another lower. so this one is one of those coins I mentioned earlier where it's an uptrend and this is a pullback. so at least have you have some type of opportunity to get long in case the market does go higher. somebody asked for decreed and that makes sense. this is a, you know, one of one of the top 30- I guess it is coins, but nothing, I nothing much on this. it definitely has the makings of around the bottom, but we do have new lows in March. I don't like that and this was not exactly an uptrend or a rally. I mean, we did have some big spikes, but don't trust wicks like that again, um, meaningless to a large extent. so the bulk of these candles seem like it kind of came over bottom but could easily continue rolling lower. there isn't a trend for me to be to support myself on this one, so that's why I don't want to be part of this. for a trade, even intermediate term doesn't seem like it has broken out at all or formed any type of new trend. so for me this is an avoid ENJ. so this one had a nice trend, but I think this is not really more. this is more of a- uh, what do you want to call it? not a parabolic surge, but certainly it's sort of a game-changing surge. so this this doesn't classify as a trend. this is more of just, uh, an awakening to some extent. so I've talked about this one for a while. since it kind of lost its upward structure, like I've talked about with Binance, it's now just trended lower. so I think we want to get back down to this cluster. it's not until we get down here that I would be looking maybe for another sort of long trade. so it's got a little more work to go, I believe, a lot of profit taking still going on, and now it's just lost its allure and people have moved on to something else. so you know you always want to be trading the one, especially in the altcoin space. you want to be trading early the ones and the coins that people are talking about and really jumping on, because it is a very speculative market and and the crowd moves from one coin to the next to the next fairly rapidly and this one is now just not something that's in focus. so just be aware of that. EOS actually is a beautiful looking chart. we have big bottom December lows. it's pulled out and didn't actually sell off that much at all. actually, it's actually shown a lot of relative strength against Bitcoin. so this is one you want to be buying. you want to be long for the long term. I think it has a lot of potential long term from a trade standpoint as well. you can be going long here because it's just holding up really well. so this one is maybe- or at least so far from the ones I've reviewed- the best looking of them all. ETC had a breakout last week. come back, I wouldn't classify this as an uptrend, so I don't want to be buying a dip. I don't really see much I like here, to be honest with you, I don't like the technology either. I don't see why Ethereum Classic is even around. that maybe is influencing my- my short-term view here. but yeah, I mean makings of around and bottom- December lows again, but- and maybe a pull back to the 10- 20 moving day moving average. so it's not too bad, but I don't see a good trade here. there's just other ones that I like much more. Gold Chain was starting to look really promising, but it's come all the way back here. I don't like buying bottoms for trying to pick lows. I mean, I I kind of find that that doesn't work too often, but this has a couple of lows already. so it's possible. if you like this, this could be a good long term entry. if you kind of want to hold this for a long term. if you might love the technology. I don't know enough about it, but certainly you don't want to be taking a position and then um, letting it go below these two lows that we have, one back in October and one back in February. so be aware of that. you could could play the triple kind of bottom aspect to this, but yeah, not enough relative strength. typically, if something's near a bottom, it's there for a reason it's not positive. you're just, you're just trying to guess at a low and get in early, but in the long run I'm not sure if they give you the best odds. Grin continues to make new lows. um, this is just a horrible looking chart, sorry, it's just red everywhere and making lower lows consistently. I think this is going to take some more time to stabilize and find kind of a bottom. it is only still a new project, a new coin, so just be patient with this one. I don't see a trade. I don't see anything from a long term standpoint either. ICX was one of those coins that I was looking at recently for a pullback, you know, because it does have a little bit of an uptrend, a little concern that maybe it's come back too much. if it can break back above this sort of level here, then it could be a buy we're using kind of. you know, maybe the full body of the candles stop, I'm not sure. but overall, um, it needs more work. not enough of an uptrend for me to get excited about the pullback. so just this is: watch on the watch list for now. see what it can do. even just being patient on this one, waiting for it to come back above this line or even the the recent highs and moving, moving my alert- maybe back to recent highs. wait for it to re-establish an uptrend before wanting to get long again on this one self key. um, no, very bad. um, this is obviously- again- I think I say this every week- probably some type of altcoin- uh, sorry, let's talk about like micro cap, um coin, but new lows avoid. get out. if you're in this, get your money and run. link showed a very nice uptrend from back in July, which is probably the best looking up trend that we have, even better than light coin. so beautiful looking chart. we can excuse, then, the the really significant drop here. um, if, if the altcoin space is moving higher, I think this will recover. it's just as a beautiful uptrend overall, um, so this is a good opportunity to get long if you'd like the project. from a long-term standpoint, this is offering you a good 40 discount from the recent highs and an opportunity to get back in on a trend. from a trade standpoint, I want to see this recover and maybe get back up into this area before looking to get long. lisk, on the other hand, is in a consistent downtrend. this is not even this is not a good looking chart from a short or long-term standpoint as well. um, started to- maybe you know, to get back up and try and form a trend higher and uptrend, but never really did. never really took off significantly enough, in my opinion, to warrant buying. the pullback ltc is a perfect example of an uptrend and this being a pullback- nice big pullback here- uh, significant- stopped out quite a few people. I think you can go long again now and kind of use the bottom of the wick here and, you know, give it a little more cushion as your stop. um, although you may want to first see the signs of a recovery. uh, of course, the further you let it get away from you, the the more the the gap becomes between your entry and your risk. so your smaller position should be. so you may want to give this an opportunity to get back above at least sort of the, the high of the candle that represents the low. so yesterday's candle is the low, using the high. so around about this uh 16 600 level, getting back above that can trigger a buy, which is also a move back above the 10-day moving average, and then you can use kind of the low of yesterday's candle as your stop. keep an eye on this one. this one is a um. one of the types of this is the type of trend you want to be buying in in this type of market and at least you know that if all coins continue higher, then this is most likely going to continue this trend up. mana coin: yeah nothing. nothing i really like here and this is just sideways chopping for pretty much the entire year. and if you can pull back all the way down to the bottom here, it's a good entry for a long-term play. but from a trade standpoint, there's nothing here that interests me at all. mkr did have a nice uptrend. um didn't roll over, like many things i expected, and i think i talked about buying a pullback to kind of this breakout point. it's down below that, so that concerns me, and we do have quite a bit of hugging of the bollinger band here. so this was bullish to me as a pullback buy potential during the week, but now it seems to exceeded that, so i don't like that as well. so i'm just gonna have to just wait and see. on this one, nano was a new request in the in the comment section this week. um, this one actually isn't bad because, yes, it only it doesn't have an uptrend, but it has a rounded bottom. the last low was back in august and it didn't pull back that much. so you know, like i said before, ones that pulled back without an uptrend i'm not interested in, but this one didn't pull back at all and it's forming that that kind of bottom here as well. um, so i like this one here. this is something you can get long. if you love the tech, you definitely. yeah, this chart looks pretty good to me, um, and also it has a trade up trade potential. now, if it's going to make new recent highs and new sort of six month highs, this is an opportunity to get long. maybe use one of these candles below here as your stop. so this is a good looking chart. thanks for pointing that out in the comment section. now, omg was looking really good, had a nice uptrend in play- higher high, higher high, higher lows- but now we have a breakdown, so i don't like this. i think if, if this move down held these lows here, then that would have been positive. but we have quite a bit of separation now between the 10 and 20 day moving average and where price is today and of course we have that cross. so, uh, i think i want to avoid this one at the moment. this one has the potential to go lower. ont is not broken. it has a nice pullback and a nice uptrend, again more more of a pullback than i would have liked. um, so from a trade standpoint, i'm not sure if i want to be buying it yet until it can move higher. maybe back above the 10 day moving average would get me interested again in this one. overall, the charts not too bad, similar to a lot of the breakdowns that we see, but nothing, nothing horrendous yet to the point where the charts busted, but it is getting close to that. it's going to want to reverse pretty soon to keep this trend looking healthy and looking positive. yeah, cutom is breaking down here. um, another reason why i didn't really want to get into this one. it's now broken kind of below this cluster here, which was kind of a breakout point. you know i'm kind of mixed feelings about this one. i do think it has a lot of long-term potential. i think if you, if you like this one, you want to be buying in this area. this is a good, nice, wide bottom here, ignoring this ridiculous work here on binance, but you know we do have a lot of lows in this zone here. you know maybe we'll get another one soon over here, um. so from a long-term standpoint- i like from a short-term standpoint- i think you want to wait for this to re-establish an upturn and get above the the recent highs that it made before looking to trigger another long trade. rlc continues a nice uptrend, didn't really break down and continues higher. so this one here: if you went long, stay long. there is a trade opportunity here as well. if you can find the right setup that suits your style. i do like this chart and i think it looks positive. if you like the technology- i don't know anything about it- then this is still a good looking chart in my opinion. all right, the good old raven- um, pretty good. nice pullback, um, healthy pullback, nothing crazy. it had a major move and has really held fairly well. i think this one could be a candidate for getting long again and looking maybe another new sustained uptrend. i think we would be wrong, though, if it kind of moved back below these two lines here. um, that would definitely negate, i think, the trend at that point. so this one here was over a week ago came back to test it. so if that trend continues low and breaks below this line, then i think you have a bit of a problem, uh, in the short term, although it could be moving all the way back to the original breakout point to be able to establish a new longer term trend. so in the short term, this is a potential to swing. you want to see it come back, swing and, you know, get back above the 10 and 20 day moving average before maybe getting long, um, and then otherwise. look at this zone here, which i think i highlighted last week as potentially where it's coming back to for more of an intermediate term structure or uptrend, coming off this and, you know, going higher for the rest of uh or most of 2019.. strat shows me nothing to get excited about. the only thing that's interesting is that there's a huge sort of base here, but until it gets above that line, there is nothing to be had here, because this is near the lows and could easily break down further. so avoid this one. resist any temptation to sort of buy, buy a bottom, because it has more of a more, more of a chance to break it. lower than it does, higher than it does, higher than it does, higher than it does, higher than it does, higher than it does, higher than the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and

{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-03-06?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Wednesday morning in New York. Another update here on the Bitcoin chart. Not a whole lot to talk about, although we do have some strength in the last couple of days, especially yesterday. Just zooming in here, it looks like we may have the half cycle low at around about day 26. Reason why I'm saying that, I'm just looking at the RSI here. I'm looking at the way it popped pretty strongly yesterday, and now is trading above the 10-day moving average. This to me looks like it has formed a half cycle low. Looking at some of the indicators as well, looking like we might be swinging out from my cycle indicator from a half cycle standpoint. So that's good news. And if that's true, of course, it's good news. What it looks like it could be doing here is that we have a pretty shallow half cycle low in that case. That does set up the possibility that we could actually go on and make a right translated cycle and new highs and put the bear market and the four-year cycle low behind us. So that would look something like, kind of like this. Rally up, probably find some resistance at the half cycle high and the last cycle high over here. So bounce back down and then maybe test just one more time and then go at that point. And then we can still get maybe our move into well into the $4,000 range and then come up for top in the cycle, probably around, let's just say, March 20th, 14 days from here. That's around kind of day 45, maybe even day 50. That gives us then about 10 or so days to come back down, test, maybe come down into this sort of range here. Okay, and then form a cycle low and then keep going from that point. That's the bullish scenario. It's still on the table. There's no reason why it wouldn't be on the table at this point. We don't have a series of lower lows, even though we didn't have a higher high at the half cycle point. The half cycle point in the end is only a very short-term pivot point. What's going to matter is where it ends up from a high for the cycle itself, for the full 60-day cycle. So the way I've drawn it here, this day 18 high would become meaningless to a large extent at least. That would become the cycle high. Okay, and then what you'd have is cycle low, high, higher low, number one, higher high, number two, cycle low, higher low, number three. That's a trend change. That is a new series of higher highs. That would be a right translated cycle here. And now things start to look really positive again. Now, of course, there's a lot of ifs and buts in that. And we've only got one higher low at the moment. We don't have a higher high. That's just a line I've drawn on the chart. I'm giving you the outlook here, the potential at least, of what could happen. That is, for now, the bullish scenario and how a bullish scenario would play out. But, you know, I've said this many times. This is kind of the midpoint in a cycle when you don't have a clear trend is the chopping zone. And what I mean by that is it's very hard to get a position either long or short that's going to do well for you because you're kind of guessing at this point. We don't have, if you look at this trend here, it's just up and down. You know, it's moving sideways, but up and down, up and down. It's very hard to get any type of traction going, any type of trend. And if you look at the overall trend, it's still really down if you look going back into 2018. So there isn't anything here to hang our hats on. And that's why I call it the chopping zone. Now, I like to trade long on the cycle low around the day 60 area, because I know there's a good chance we'll get a good rally. And I like to trade at the end of a cycle short because there's a good chance we'll get a sell-off. But right now at the day 28 area, where we don't know if we're going to get a new higher high, it really is a difficult time to be putting capital to work and hoping to be successful. So even though I'm outlining this, you know, potential, sorry about that, didn't mean to draw that, this potential bullish scenario, there's also a bearish scenario still to come. And I'll draw that. And this is where I don't want to be trading at the moment. I want to be just paying attention. But you know, we could get a bounce up here. Okay. The half cycle, the second half of the cycle doesn't, doesn't create a higher high. So day 18 remains the high for the cycle, which is a left translated cycle. Okay. So the peak occurring before the midpoint. So then we come back down. Okay. And then again, same type of thing, same scenario I've been talking about. I don't know if bounces off this cycle low. Don't know if it bounces off this cycle low. I don't know if we get down into one more bear market low, one more low for the four year cycle. All those scenarios are on the table at the moment. That's why, you know, in trading, I know some of you want a firm 100% prediction. This is what's going to happen. I don't do that. I just can't do that because I, you know, everyone's wrong too often. We have to outline the possible scenarios and how it may play out and then formulate our trades around those scenarios as the trade and as, as price moves along one of these lines. Okay. So if we see that, you know, the red lines playing out, then we can act accordingly. Or if we see the blue lines, you know, playing out, we can also act accordingly and position ourselves differently. Both of these scenarios have different types of trade strategies. So we just need to formulate those as they come along and give ourselves the best, best risk reward opportunity, but also the best opportunity to get a winning trade as opposed to a losing trade. Right now where we stand today, going long or short, there really isn't a, you know, a good, a good opportunity to, to come out of this with a profitable trade of any type with those long or short. So we wait and see, wait and see how this progresses. Uh, we still have an opportunity to, to come down and make one more half cycle low lower. So we may not have a cycle low yet for the half cycle. So we may still come down and make this, but then it really is the same scenario after that. It comes up and links to this area here. Okay. And then we decide whether or not it wants to go up and make a higher high or just reverse lower and make a sort of a lower low, or at least retest these lows here. Again, patience is the key in this type of environment, this type of market. I know this is kind of repetitive in many ways, talking about the same chopping sideways action. Trust me, it's going to eventually, um, it's going to eventually lead to a new trend, a new longer term trend. And that's a trend we'll be able to ride at the moment. I just want you all to preserve your capital. Don't get stuck chopping around trying to find the right trade and instead pay a whole lot of fees and, you know, a whole lot of losing trades. Hey, just looking at some other coins now, Binance coin still looks phenomenal here. Uh, actually almost going vertical now. So it's too late. Um, you know, if you have a position longterm, that's great. You may want to even take some off the table. Maybe you don't, um, that's just good for you if you have that, but, uh, you look at the structure of this sort of nice uptrend, then right here, it kind of gets, um, kind of gets really speculative at this point. And this is the parabolic move. I think we're into the final stage of this move. It can obviously go much higher, but, uh, it's from a trade standpoint, it's way, way, way above the bulge bands. The bulge bands are extremely wide. Look at how, look, look at the, how they, how they're sort of widening out to absolute extremes. There's nothing here that I necessarily would, would want to get on. Nothing I like that would want me to get long at this particular point. It's just way too late, unfortunately. Um, but great trade if you're on it. Um, again, you can probably use some type of trading stop strategy, but I would definitely, if you're trading this, be taking profits, at least a good portion of my profits right here at this point. Uh, enough's enough. Certainly when it comes to, to this one here, uh, Ethereum, similar to Bitcoin, actually very similar. Um, we didn't come up. So we come down here, it looks like a half cycle low come pop back up. So we could either go up here, uh, stall around the 150 range and move lower. If the, the berry scenario presented in Bitcoin, it plays out or go up, retest the, the highs that we had last week and then go on to higher highs at this point. Hard to tell. Um, but yes, look at this. So it's, it's, it's doing the same thing at the moment. It's just a matter of now where Bitcoin wants to go from the next cycle standpoint. Litecoin still is by far the, um, the best performer of them all. Uh, I think this is a type of coin that if you don't have a long-term allocation to, you can probably get it here. It looks like we're definitely now in a, I mean, it's already almost, uh, tripled. In fact, it's up 150% looks like off the bottoms. Um, that's, that looks like it, it certainly has changed train. It's broken. It's, it's, it's made a inverse head and shoulders broken. It's broken the neckline. It seems like it's on its way back up and it has a lot of room to move from a U S dollar trading pair standpoint. It can easily get back up to this sort of cluster here, $85 area. I think it can easily get back into this $108 area. It has a lot of room left to go. Um, so this is something I think you want to be getting on board. It's still not, uh, not too late. I would think, um, it's definitely like that. Now from a Bitcoin pair standpoint, maybe a little ahead of itself here, this pullback here definitely was the, and I think I had talked about that at 10 day moving. This pullback was the place to get long. Um, I didn't get long at that point from a trading standpoint, but certainly I talked a lot about it and this would definitely would have been a lot place to go. I would be holding if you did get in at that point, there's no reason to be looking to get out now. I think the next sort of cluster is back here. So there's a, let's have a look at what that looks like. Yeah. I mean, it's not that far away, honestly. Um, but I think we get to this zone pretty comfortably. So 16,000 to 18,000 zone, um, fairly quickly and fairly comfortably, I would think, but you know, like anything, it's probably going to throw you off a couple of times easily, not going to make it easier to ride that, especially now that it's got a good pole going here. It may go up a little more and then come, you know, sort of sharply lower before going up, up into the zone, something like that. But it's probably going to ride this sort of trajectory on that trend line I have here. It's not really a trend line, but it's just a, a line that kind of, um, is the mean of, uh, of this rally here. So it's probably going to sort of mirror this line here. So it may not be as steep necessarily, but you get the point here that it's going to have pullbacks and those pullbacks are going to be an opportunity to get long again. I think for sure. Now, if this comes back and retest that 10 day moving average, I probably would want to try and get long myself on a trade standpoint. Um, but you know, from, from a long-term perspective, I liked what it's doing. I do have a long-term position, so that's good as well. Um, but this has been certainly the darling at the moment of, um, of this sort of alt coin rally. So can I look at, um, XRP here? I don't like what I'm seeing here. Um, it's hanging around too long. This typically is a continuation sort of pattern. I think it could accelerate to the downside. So I, I, I'm not shorting this. I think there's just too much, too many people follow this and there's too much strength and I'm just not interested in getting too involved with Ripple at the moment, but I think this is definitely a short candidate at this point. Uh, I think this could maybe make a move all the way back down to kind of this bottom support area here around about the 6,000 range is what I would think. So just be aware of that as well. Um, just taking a look at some of the old coins, I'm going to have a full altcoin lightning post on Friday for you. Um, just taking a look at this one here, vibe looks pretty good to me. It looks like it's setting up for another move higher. This is an opportunity, perhaps stop could be right below here at these candles here, but this looks like it could be moving higher. Um, yeah, and that's pretty much it for today. Uh, that should cover the Bitcoin cycle really well. I think that we're in kind of that middle cycle point where we're just looking for direction. And, uh, that really does determine in the entire landscape and where things are going to move across the board at this point. Again, as I said, lightning report on Friday, I'll go through a full coin report list. Uh, if you have any other ones you want me to take a quick look at, again, I'm not a full technical analyst. I don't trade, um, primarily off technical charting patterns. Of course I'm a cyclist. I look at Bitcoin first and that cycle, even though that said, I can take a look at a chart for you as well. Put that in the comments and we'll get to it on Friday. All the best to you and, um, speak to you then.", "source": "episode-2019-03-06"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-12?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas, Friday morning in New York. Hope you're doing really well and looking forward to your weekend. I'm feeling a little under the weather this morning so my voice is probably going to be coming in and out somewhat. But today is the lightning report. I'm going to cover over 30 coins. The list seems to be getting longer each week so these reports are taking longer and longer. Again the disclaimer here is that my primary focus is in Bitcoin and the Bitcoin cycles. The altcoins are for trading when I see a favorable setup. Something that looks like could move higher or has a nice trend to it. I want to point that out. Again the other disclaimer is that a lot of these I'm looking at for the first time or I'm looking at them for the first time in a week since the last report. So you know like anything in trading it's best to be more familiar with the way a particular asset or coin trades. Normally each sort of asset has its own little flavor in how it sort of moves and oscillates on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis. So I'm not privy to a lot of that information. I'm looking at a lot of these charts purely in sort of a very fresh look and giving an opinion very rapidly on that. And for that point you really got to take what I say with a grain of salt and use it more just to complement whatever research or whatever you're looking at and seeing and maybe if it kind of gels with what you're seeing or if it fits with your strategy then maybe that helps. But otherwise I don't encourage anybody so just jumping all over something that I particularly say. Now if there's something I really like from a trade standpoint I'm going to trade it myself and I'm going to make an alert in that case. That's when you know I'm at least as far as I'm personally concerned vested and taking on my own risk. So maybe that those types of situations you can take maybe a little more seriously. Okay so that being said of course we'll start off with Bitcoin as we always do and you know at the moment we're seeing a little bit of a pullback, two three day pullback. I think this is very healthy and very normal. We obviously had a big surge coming out of the you know the wedge or triangle pattern here. Overall the trend is up. The trend is up on the daily chart. We have at least at least one full cycle high that is higher than the well actually even to the last one but we have at least one cycle low that is higher than the other one. But I think we have two cycle lows that are higher than the prior ones. So we definitely have a step up on the lows and we have at least one cycle high somewhere wherever this ends up being whether it's here or whether it's further out it's going to be at least one cycle higher higher than the other two. So that's just the definition of a trend, an uptrend. It may not be a solid uptrend but regardless the fact is December is the last major low. So we have to respect the fact that we're released in we're at least in some type of uptrend and we're seeing the same in the altcoin space. We are seeing many of the charts show us some have already broken out of course and doing really well like Litecoin and others but the rest of them seem to have rounded bottoms and are showing uptrends at the moment. So we need to shift our bias somewhat to be a little more bullish. I'm not saying we should not be uber bullish at this point. We are still in this sideways chopping market as far as I'm concerned but we're not in the savage bear market either where we want to be very hesitant to take trades or to be taking profit very rapidly. So just always I like to point that out in the beginning because when I approach my trading and approach my chart analysis I like to think of what the the overall trend is telling me and that kind of sets a little bit of my bias or sets my thinking and how accommodating I want to be when it comes to some of the analysis or some of the setups that I may be looking at. So for Bitcoin again pulled back back to the 10-day moving average slightly below that. Overall I like this chart. Can it go lower? I think it can go down to the 20-day moving average. I think if it gets down to say to this sort of point that's probably even you know maybe a healthy buy at this point and then we can maybe make another move up and possibly test that 5800 level area later in the cycle later in the month and if we can get a test up in that area later in the month what it does is at least puts us at a point where we're topping in the cycle later on. I mean we had some early tops even though the cycles were short. These are both left translated but with higher lows. So a mixed bag overall. It seems like we have a lot of selling pressure along with a lot of buying support here creating this sort of crunch that we see in the Bollinger Bands and crunch in the sort of triangle pattern. That's just the nature of people selling in to lower prices thinking. I think it's going to go lower and also the accumulation that we're seeing from the sidelines in Bitcoin. So we're seeing a lot of that. This now has escaped higher I think and I want to see I want to see the cycle form a top hopefully late April even into May would be nice maybe form right translated and stay in this sort of zone here above the prior two highs that we have for cycle highs and uh below the 6800 5800 level. I think that sets up the scene for more accumulation and more of this uptrend and then you know later by the summer maybe looking at sort of breaking out of that zone and coming up higher. And you see something similar on the weekly chart here's the here's the weekly good volume coming in more recently uh seven straight weeks of green candle so it's not unlikely or unusual to see a red candle come in maybe even two we may inform uh sort of a three week consolidation um you know sort of like a a flag here um on the weekly chart as well that's possible I mean you know we have to wait a few more weeks of course but something like that before moving higher and that puts us in that that can create the right translated cycle that we that we want to see at this point we haven't seen a right translated cycle in many many cycles but right here filling in this gap see there's very little fill in here it's just this one big bar coming down and then most of the all the action is below you know below this 4200 area so filling in this gap here for maybe one or two cycles would be ideal before taking a few cracks at this heavy resistance area that will I think will provide a lot of resistance for most of the year okay so that's the bitcoin analysis from a trade standpoint I don't see anything right now um because it's not such a clean setup but you know you've got a couple of candles down here around the 4700 area if we get a little further down we may be able to consider taking some type of a long trade and then using maybe those candles or something like that it's not very clean but I do like to pull back I mean I don't want to short any of this it's too early in the cycle and this looks like just a controlled pullback and consolidation here and nothing more sinister than that on the four hour chart you know you kind of see it rolling over here if we can kind of roll back down into this sort of 47 4800 area uh maybe an opportunity but for now I mean I'm sure traders can find an opportunity here but for me I'm just going to sit the sidelines wait it out and look for something more obvious before wanting to get long what I do like and I'm going to switch over to ethereum right now so ethereum dollar is still a position I hold um I still like this chart here it's got to be honest with you even though it's sort of come back we had a little bit of a breakout it's come back it's retested and dropped slightly below the breakout point back below the 10 day moving average which I don't like but still above the 20. so if as long as it stays above the 20 um and and that 20 right now is at um what is it it's at 150 actually it's 156 which is where my stop is as well so um right here is where my stop 156. so I still like this position here I can hopefully see it rally back up now that's that sort of retest and spend some time here so this is what I see on ethereum versus the dollar still position that I hold if you didn't get in it still offers a decent uh risk reward here I think the reward is potential is uh all the way up sort of in the in a 230 240 range um and then the risk of course at the moment is around about 10 dollars uh for each ethereum down to 156 so it's a decent opportunity the chart still looks good as far as I'm concerned ethereum btc is holding up hasn't done anything but it hasn't dropped either um looking like nice sort of bottoming pattern as well so this one has the opportunity to break higher hasn't made any real moves so nothing I like significantly on this chart but um you know like I like the ethereum versus dollar more than anything else uh just playing around with some something yeah I would need a break sort of higher this area to kind of kind of convince me that we have a bottom in here bottom in play and then a move higher so I'm sticking more with ethereum versus the dollar all right now let's get into the main list of coins now let me be clear on something a lot of these coins uh have a decent reversal or decent sell-off over the last week so there's been a good sell-off the ones that did not show breakouts and positive uptrends did not look good I'm going to skip over I'm going to cover them but just going to the analysis is going to be very brief don't want to be I don't want to be in a coin or trading something that didn't break out that didn't have relative strength that's not showing me a nice chart pattern like ada is right here because I want to buy pullbacks for coins that are in an uptrend I don't want to be buying stuff that didn't break out the only forms that seem to be forming around the bottom but it's since not broken out and actually come back near the lows there's quite a few of those types of charts and those are the ones you want to avoid I know there's a tendency for people to think oh there's value there that hasn't made a move yet if I just buy it it's going to make a move no that's a trap yeah some of them may make moves but a lot of them may easily make new lows as well I think you want to be buying the strength you want to be buying the charts like this one here that looks good that is showing us a pullback so this one here looks really good um I mean I'm long this one still I'm holding this long the initial pattern I drew back in March over a month ago it's pretty much playing out we have a nice pullback right here I think this is a buy you could use if you know if you want to trade this you could I think you can use a couple of these wicks here as your stop so around about the 1500 level 1500 satoshi this looks like it's pulled back if it's going to continue the uptrend then this might be the extent of the sell-off so ADA to me looks really good I'm holding my last position for at least this 2400 area but maybe even this sort of 3000 area is my target on that so ARK fits in the middle of those two uptrend versus hasn't broken out type of coins I mentioned this one does have a breakout but not a solid uptrend and we do have a good pullback all the way kind of to I wouldn't really call it a neckline but at least this line here where we did see a few of the tops before breaking out so overall this isn't a bad chart this is a good pullback I think if it consists if the whole altcoin space could find a low right at this point this one has some good potential so if you've been following this one has potential as well definitely back to this point is is positive and we could could rally up from here air swap is a horrible looking chart it has exactly what I said before around the bottom without breaking higher and now it's breaking lower so this one for me is definitely an avoid okay bat is one of one chart that I actually like more from a long-term standpoint this one broke out last week just going to sort of put something here not exactly perfectly touching but you can see you know repeated attempts in this area and then another one right here and then a good solid move and now back down so I don't know anything about the tech but if you like the tech this is a good looking chart in my opinion it's almost like kind of like a wedge as well so you've got to go that I think this looks good it's broken out come back retested this is a good entry here for the long-term play not sure from a trade standpoint what I see here if I don't see if I see anything but this one I like from a long term this is a very pretty looking chart long term wise Bitcoin Cash ABC nice move up another move up consolidating I think as long as it's above the 20-day moving average here this is a good looking chart and stick with the trend you can buy this area here maybe use these two stops these two wicks the bottoms of the lows of these as your stop point but this does look like good chart it seems like it's at least in an uptrend um and yeah this is uh this is a probably a bit of buy right now if you're holding if you bought this and you're holding definitely stay stay with it stick with it and then somebody asked about um in in the comments section about Bitcoin Cash versus the dollar similar looking chart here actually maybe a little a little prettier as well because we had this good move above the Bollinger Bands now it's coming back again stay long on this one this one does look good um I think your exit is probably below the 20 and on a closing basis or something like that but um you know it's had a double already so that's you know so you definitely be taking some profit if you got in sort of in this area down here don't want to be uh riding your entire move here take some profits already doubled but this one has potential to maybe even get up to sort of the 350 400 range fairly easily and even more because it does have a lot of room higher uh at least up to like the 490 500 area and I think also this is probably catching a bit because bitcoin sv has not been doing well it's it's negative in the news and and being that that was a fork and bitcoin abc exists because of that fork then it's very likely that some of the value is getting transferred over as well yeah sv as I said last week looks horrible don't like anything about this chart hasn't done anything I would have thought it would have had some type of rally with bitcoin abc or bitcoin cash it has not and like I said earlier again there's a lot of negative press around craig wright and sort of the whole organization in general so this does not look positive I would avoid this finance coin to me now looks like I'm out topped we have a cross of the 10 with the 20 day moving average so that's the first sign we are touching the lower bollinger bands not just once but twice I don't I don't mind a touch the lower bollinger bands in an uptrend that's generally a good buying signal but this is done in a couple times now and now seems to be hugging the bottom bollinger bands which means it's now trending that way as opposed to just being over oversold so for me this now is a sell or avoid if you rode most of this I think it's time to start seriously considering taking a lot of the profit keeping some if you like it from a long-term standpoint but it's had a major run and people made a lot of money in this so I think you've got to be cautious here that if profit taking release begins then it could get much worse and then also you can look at kind of this low here exceeded that low here you would have thought that bounce off that area so to me it looks like now we have the makings of a new trend lower so just be cautious and be be aware of that if you're in binance coin bit shares kind of had a breakout although it's a you know I don't trust bigger weeks like this on on lightly traded coins but I wouldn't call this a nice uptrend yet this is kind of a rounded bottom and I don't like the fact that we really pierced the lower bollinger band here I think we could be trending lower again this one um doesn't look like a nice pullback in an uptrend as far as I'm concerned it just looks too severe for me so I would avoid this one exactly the same type of thing on civic coin that we have on bit shares exactly the same analysis just too much of a downtrend too much of a pullback even more so for civic coin so this one for me is not a good looking chart I would definitely avoid this dash on the other hand is in an uptrend it has this step up step up step up so I think why as long as this prior low holds it is an opportunity to possibly get long again you if you get long for a trade the the uptrend is still in play we do have a clear higher highs and higher low structure here this pullback is significant and healthy so if you want to get long for the intermediate sort of time frame you could I think and then definitely use this as your stop at the moment which isn't too far lower I think this could continue the structure if certainly if all coins are going to get another bid in the next sort of few days or week then this one looks like it certainly would participate and kind of make that move higher again and make another higher high before coming back down and forming another lower so this one is one of those coins I mentioned earlier where it's an uptrend and this is a pullback so at least have you have some type of opportunity to get long in case the market does go higher somebody asked for decreed and that makes sense this is a you know one of one of the top 30 I guess it is coins but nothing I nothing much on this it definitely has the makings of around the bottom but we do have new lows in March I don't like that and this was not exactly an uptrend or a rally I mean we did have some big spikes but don't trust wicks like that again um meaningless to a large extent so the bulk of these candles seem like it kind of came over bottom but could easily continue rolling lower there isn't a trend for me to be to support myself on this one so that's why I don't want to be part of this for a trade even intermediate term doesn't seem like it has broken out at all or formed any type of new trend so for me this is an avoid ENJ so this one had a nice trend but I think this is not really more this is more of a uh what do you want to call it not a parabolic surge but certainly it's sort of a game-changing surge so this this doesn't classify as a trend this is more of just uh an awakening to some extent so I've talked about this one for a while since it kind of lost its upward structure like I've talked about with Binance it's now just trended lower so I think we want to get back down to this cluster it's not until we get down here that I would be looking maybe for another sort of long trade so it's got a little more work to go I believe a lot of profit taking still going on and now it's just lost its allure and people have moved on to something else so you know you always want to be trading the one especially in the altcoin space you want to be trading early the ones and the coins that people are talking about and really jumping on because it is a very speculative market and and the crowd moves from one coin to the next to the next fairly rapidly and this one is now just not something that's in focus so just be aware of that EOS actually is a beautiful looking chart we have big bottom December lows it's pulled out and didn't actually sell off that much at all actually it's actually shown a lot of relative strength against Bitcoin so this is one you want to be buying you want to be long for the long term I think it has a lot of potential long term from a trade standpoint as well you can be going long here because it's just holding up really well so this one is maybe or at least so far from the ones I've reviewed the best looking of them all ETC had a breakout last week come back I wouldn't classify this as an uptrend so I don't want to be buying a dip I don't really see much I like here to be honest with you I don't like the technology either I don't see why Ethereum Classic is even around that maybe is influencing my my short-term view here but yeah I mean makings of around and bottom December lows again but and maybe a pull back to the 10 20 moving day moving average so it's not too bad but I don't see a good trade here there's just other ones that I like much more Gold Chain was starting to look really promising but it's come all the way back here I don't like buying bottoms for trying to pick lows I mean I I kind of find that that doesn't work too often but this has a couple of lows already so it's possible if you like this this could be a good long term entry if you kind of want to hold this for a long term if you might love the technology I don't know enough about it but certainly you don't want to be taking a position and then um letting it go below these two lows that we have one back in October and one back in February so be aware of that you could could play the triple kind of bottom aspect to this but yeah not enough relative strength typically if something's near a bottom it's there for a reason it's not positive you're just you're just trying to guess at a low and get in early but in the long run I'm not sure if they give you the best odds Grin continues to make new lows um this is just a horrible looking chart sorry it's just red everywhere and making lower lows consistently I think this is going to take some more time to stabilize and find kind of a bottom it is only still a new project a new coin so just be patient with this one I don't see a trade I don't see anything from a long term standpoint either ICX was one of those coins that I was looking at recently for a pullback you know because it does have a little bit of an uptrend a little concern that maybe it's come back too much if it can break back above this sort of level here then it could be a buy we're using kind of you know maybe the full body of the candles stop I'm not sure but overall um it needs more work not enough of an uptrend for me to get excited about the pullback so just this is watch on the watch list for now see what it can do even just being patient on this one waiting for it to come back above this line or even the the recent highs and moving moving my alert maybe back to recent highs wait for it to re-establish an uptrend before wanting to get long again on this one self key um no very bad um this is obviously again I think I say this every week probably some type of altcoin uh sorry let's talk about like micro cap um coin but new lows avoid get out if you're in this get your money and run link showed a very nice uptrend from back in July which is probably the best looking up trend that we have even better than light coin so beautiful looking chart we can excuse then the the really significant drop here um if if the altcoin space is moving higher I think this will recover it's just as a beautiful uptrend overall um so this is a good opportunity to get long if you'd like the project from a long-term standpoint this is offering you a good 40 discount from the recent highs and an opportunity to get back in on a trend from a trade standpoint I want to see this recover and maybe get back up into this area before looking to get long lisk on the other hand is in a consistent downtrend this is not even this is not a good looking chart from a short or long-term standpoint as well um started to maybe you know to get back up and try and form a trend higher and uptrend but never really did never really took off significantly enough in my opinion to warrant buying the pullback ltc is a perfect example of an uptrend and this being a pullback nice big pullback here uh significant stopped out quite a few people I think you can go long again now and kind of use the bottom of the wick here and you know give it a little more cushion as your stop um although you may want to first see the signs of a recovery uh of course the further you let it get away from you the the more the the gap becomes between your entry and your risk so your smaller position should be so you may want to give this an opportunity to get back above at least sort of the the high of the candle that represents the low so yesterday's candle is the low using the high so around about this uh 16 600 level getting back above that can trigger a buy which is also a move back above the 10-day moving average and then you can use kind of the low of yesterday's candle as your stop keep an eye on this one this one is a um one of the types of this is the type of trend you want to be buying in in this type of market and at least you know that if all coins continue higher then this is most likely going to continue this trend up mana coin yeah nothing nothing i really like here and this is just sideways chopping for pretty much the entire year and if you can pull back all the way down to the bottom here it's a good entry for a long-term play but from a trade standpoint there's nothing here that interests me at all mkr did have a nice uptrend um didn't roll over like many things i expected and i think i talked about buying a pullback to kind of this breakout point it's down below that so that concerns me and we do have quite a bit of hugging of the bollinger band here so this was bullish to me as a pullback buy potential during the week but now it seems to exceeded that so i don't like that as well so i'm just gonna have to just wait and see on this one nano was a new request in the in the comment section this week um this one actually isn't bad because yes it only it doesn't have an uptrend but it has a rounded bottom the last low was back in august and it didn't pull back that much so you know like i said before ones that pulled back without an uptrend i'm not interested in but this one didn't pull back at all and it's forming that that kind of bottom here as well um so i like this one here this is something you can get long if you love the tech you definitely yeah this chart looks pretty good to me um and also it has a trade up trade potential now if it's going to make new recent highs and new sort of six month highs this is an opportunity to get long maybe use one of these candles below here as your stop so this is a good looking chart thanks for pointing that out in the comment section now omg was looking really good had a nice uptrend in play higher high higher high higher lows but now we have a breakdown so i don't like this i think if if this move down held these lows here then that would have been positive but we have quite a bit of separation now between the 10 and 20 day moving average and where price is today and of course we have that cross so uh i think i want to avoid this one at the moment this one has the potential to go lower ont is not broken it has a nice pullback and a nice uptrend again more more of a pullback than i would have liked um so from a trade standpoint i'm not sure if i want to be buying it yet until it can move higher maybe back above the 10 day moving average would get me interested again in this one overall the charts not too bad similar to a lot of the breakdowns that we see but nothing nothing horrendous yet to the point where the charts busted but it is getting close to that it's going to want to reverse pretty soon to keep this trend looking healthy and looking positive yeah cutom is breaking down here um another reason why i didn't really want to get into this one it's now broken kind of below this cluster here which was kind of a breakout point you know i'm kind of mixed feelings about this one i do think it has a lot of long-term potential i think if you if you like this one you want to be buying in this area this is a good nice wide bottom here ignoring this ridiculous work here on binance but you know we do have a lot of lows in this zone here you know maybe we'll get another one soon over here um so from a long-term standpoint i like from a short-term standpoint i think you want to wait for this to re-establish an upturn and get above the the recent highs that it made before looking to trigger another long trade rlc continues a nice uptrend didn't really break down and continues higher so this one here if you went long stay long there is a trade opportunity here as well if you can find the right setup that suits your style i do like this chart and i think it looks positive if you like the technology i don't know anything about it then this is still a good looking chart in my opinion all right the good old raven um pretty good nice pullback um healthy pullback nothing crazy it had a major move and has really held fairly well i think this one could be a candidate for getting long again and looking maybe another new sustained uptrend i think we would be wrong though if it kind of moved back below these two lines here um that would definitely negate i think the trend at that point so this one here was over a week ago came back to test it so if that trend continues low and breaks below this line then i think you have a bit of a problem uh in the short term although it could be moving all the way back to the original breakout point to be able to establish a new longer term trend so in the short term this is a potential to swing you want to see it come back swing and you know get back above the 10 and 20 day moving average before maybe getting long um and then otherwise look at this zone here which i think i highlighted last week as potentially where it's coming back to for more of an intermediate term structure or uptrend coming off this and you know going higher for the rest of uh or most of 2019. strat shows me nothing to get excited about the only thing that's interesting is that there's a huge sort of base here but until it gets above that line there is nothing to be had here because this is near the lows and could easily break down further so avoid this one resist any temptation to sort of buy buy a bottom because it has more of a more more of a chance to break it lower than it does higher than it does higher than it does higher than it does higher than it does higher than it does higher than the lows and the lows and the lows and the

{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-03-20?", "input": "", "output": "Hey, good afternoon Fintac members. it's Bob Lucas Wednesday afternoon around 6 pm here in New York Eastern Time. hope you're doing really well. so we had kind of a roller coaster day, I guess not unusual for a Fed monthly or not monthly, bimonthly FOMC meeting. this one was a little bit of a surprise, I guess, in that the Fed came out and pretty much said that they're going to counsel the rate hikes for 2019. they've lowered GDP forecast, which means they want to be more dovish, of course, and an end to the balance sheet runoff, so that, overall, is as pretty much as dovish and as bullish as you're ever going to get it's. it's also a clear indication that the Fed is pretty much 100% behind, behind, you know, getting aggressive and being aggressive and being more responsive, I think, more in real time, as opposed to other Fed chairs who are probably more lagging, data driven, and I think that may just be the style of the current, you know, Fed chairman Powell and how he works or could be politically influenced to some extent, and also just a sign of the times and how we're moving into more real time and more real time data and analytics. point is that the Fed here seems to be adaptive and he seems to indicate that, you know, if this market continues to fall or obviously the economy weakens even slightly, that he's going to be going to be pushing some dovish type policies to help rebound quickly. so that obviously pushed gold higher today. it pushed gold higher significantly from what looked like at one point and I was looking at the four hour chart. it was looked like it was breaking down at one point. today. here it is here, uh, before that bar. so it broke down below kind of this trend line- uh, it's only a four hour trend line, of course, over the current cycle, but it looked like it was really breaking down. it was down to 12.98 at one point and then, of course, the the Fed announcement came out and rallied as high as 13.17, just about um the Fed announcement, and then, of course, the Fed announcement came out and then, of course, the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement. the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement. the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement. was the Fed announcement and the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement. the Fed announcement was the Fed announcement. was the Fed announcement. was the Fed announcement?

{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-01?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Monday morning, 8 a.m. here in New York. I hope you're doing really well. I hope you had a great weekend. So I think we have a really interesting video for today. I see a lot of developments on the charts that get me a little excited and I don't get excited too often, but there's a lot of encouraging type of moves across the entire space, whether it's Bitcoin, altcoins, market caps. We're seeing a lot of really strong evidence that we could have and most likely have the four-year cycle low in December behind us. Now, let's get stuck into it. This is the weekly full cycles report where we focus mostly on Bitcoin and the cycles. Of course, the Bitcoin cycle is the main driver of the entire space with a market cap dominance of over 50% still. It stands to reason that the longest serving cryptocurrency and the most secure or the most mostly widely followed, sorry, mostly held and followed coin is the dominant asset class for this entire space. So understanding what Bitcoin is doing helps us across the entire spectrum of trading in the crypto space. So now we're on day 53 of a 60-day cycle. We are getting close to the next cycle low. The last cycle ended on day 53 where we are right now. The cycle before that ended on day 65. You see a few other ones 51, 56, 84. That one was the most stretched cycle that we've had. Point being is that we are now really close to the point where we should be seeing a cycle low. But here is the rub. Here is the problem or here is where it is not so clear. We are on day 53 where we should be in a really, we should easily be into the declining portion of the cycle by this point. Look at any one of these cycles. Look at the last one here, declining last 20 days, declining last 30 days. Not so much on this one here, but not, certainly not going higher. Declining, declining, declining. Every cycle by day 53 is declining. But this one is actually going up. It's rallying. I wouldn't call it rallying, but it's moving higher. It's every dip is being bought and it's moving higher. It's above the 10-day moving average. Its trend is higher. And this is confusing. Well, it's not confusing in the sense that we don't know what's going on. It's just confusing to the person that looks at cycles from a low, high, low, high, standpoint. We're expecting this to drop down and it's not doing that. So there's a couple of things that are going on here. One is that it's just going to be an extended cycle, meaning it's going to form a low around day 65, day 70, maybe even day 75, for example. So there's still time for it to kind of get up and come down as this chart here indicates. That is the first possibility and probably still the most likely one, because we always want to assume that we're going to get a price decline towards the end of the cycle. That happens in around about 95% of cycles, even the bullish ones, even the one that runs really late and doesn't decline towards the end. We often, know, we always see in the end that tail end dip, whether it's a shakeout, whether it's just a profit taking event, we typically always see it. Okay. So this still remains my primary outlook. However, there is another alternative here. And that is that we're going to see, and this is going to be new for many of you. Okay. So I'll try my best to explain it at a high level that also makes sense for you. But there's a concept in cycles that we can see a cycle low occur without a price decline, but it occurs over time. So what that might look like is something like, let's just get another color here. So it looks something like this. And typically you get the full cycle length when this happens. So all the way into day 65, say for example, 60 to 65, you get this type of thing where it hasn't gone down and it hasn't really gone up. This becomes what we call a time-based cycle low. And simply what it means is there is selling pressure because it is late in the cycle. People are selling it, but there is just way too much underlying strength and demand and buying support at this late portion of the cycle that the price is not allowed to drop. It's just not given an opportunity to drop because there is just too much demand buying up the asset. And what happens is all that selling pressure that exists during the decline, the declining phase of the cycle is then exhausted. And then once the natural cycle low comes, so around the day 60, 65 range, for example, once that comes and goes, the selling pressure becomes exhausted. So you've got this situation where sellers and buyers cause an equilibrium in price. It doesn't move higher or lower. And then because there was so much demand on the buy side and the cycle ends, the sellers become essentially exhausted and then you get this move higher. And these types of cycle lows occur, one, during reversals typically, and two, they come after this period, long period of, sorry, long period of accumulation, like we've seen over the last, what is now almost, almost four months, three and a half months. So this here at the moment is still acting as a, you know, pretty significant accumulation period. So this, this is what we could be seeing right now as the alternative scenario. Now, I don't, I would be a little surprised to be honest with you if we saw an upside move right from this point, because we are on day 53. What I want to see is either kind of more of a sideways chop for basically a week, the altcoins can continue going higher. And then it's eventually because it's a time-based cycle, we want to see it kind of into day 60, day 65. Then we want to see it come out of that and move higher pretty rapidly at that point. This would be an extremely bullish development if we go another week with just a sideways movement, even, yeah, even a week's fine, that gets us to around day 60 of the cycle. It seems a little early for an upside break to occur with a time-based cycle. So a time-based cycle low typically wants to go the full length of the cycle. Whereas something like this right now, if we are going to go down and dip, we want to see that pretty much beginning at this point right now. So any upside break from this point, like today, for example, maybe the next couple of days would probably be reversed because it is early and then come back down, shake everybody out and then move higher. So again, this isn't an exact science guys. This is a tool, this is just me telling you, looking at cycles for well over a decade, which essentially is telling me price patterns, right? And just me reading the cycles as I have with other asset classes and giving you my sense for how these typically evolve and resolve themselves. But they do surprise, they surprise often enough. So let's not be, let's not be so hard headed or absolute in how we interpret and how we trade these markets. We're looking for an edge. We're looking for ideas here on how to be prepared for the potential different scenarios that are ahead of us. I think the overall takeaway from this is that this is really bullish. Well, this is bullish in general. I think we have bullish action. And that's because if you look at this descending triangle, I was very bearish throughout all the members who have been with us since kind of the launch or when we're tracking this period right here, everyone knows I was very bearish and hopefully I protected a lot of people from this decline. But the reason why I was bearish is because we had consistent drops into and testing the bottom support area and the rallies were being sold short quicker and quicker as we went through each cycle. Now we don't have anywhere near as many cycles in this case, but you see the lows are forming higher and we're now testing more of a resistance line, just as on the downside, we were testing the support line, the bottom. So the support, sorry, the action here is coming from the bottom up and testing, you know, this area right here, as opposed to this coming from coming from the top down and pushing down, which eventually gave way. I think what we're going to see here is the same type of thing in reverse, where eventually this gives way and then we come up and we start to fill in this void here between the 4,000 and 5,000 or more like the 4,200 to sort of 6,200, $2,000 gap. That's the next evolution in my opinion. Still want to see this scenario play out. I got to be honest with you, I really want to see another move lower, whether it's a retest of this February low or retest of the December low, I really would feel much more comfortable with a really big shakeout because people are getting really excited right now on Twitter and in, you know, on blogs in general, I see the comments, people are really excited. That's good. I mean, I really, you know, ultimately I want higher prices like everybody else, but I want the market to not come back in the future over the summer and do a retest then. I prefer to see a nice big sharp retest from this point down to this sort of $3,000, $3,200 level and then come up. That for me almost puts a nail in the coffin, so to speak, for the December cycle low. Okay. That kind of completes the basing pattern as far as I'm concerned and allows the market to then move higher again. Whereas if we break from this point, I'm not saying we have to retest in the summer, but I won't feel as comfortable with a, with just where we are, where we stand in general as being the absolute bottom or at least probably I would be fine with this being the absolute bottom, but I still would be a little uncomfortable that we're going to get a massive $2,000, $3,000 decline at some point, whether it's June or whether it's sort of the August cycle low that we're going to kind of come all the way back at that point. So I want to see that come back right now as well. All right, let's take a look at the weekly chart. It's been a while since we looked at the weekly chart. I still think maybe 80%, 85% chance that the four year cycle low is in. That's a bear market low from a price standpoint. Still believe that, but I won't be shocked if it gets taken out. But if it gets taken out, it's going to happen soon because the four year cycle low is not going to stretch much further than, I mean, April would be, April was the date I said it could get to. I don't see it stretching all the way out to the June cycle low. I can see a retest perhaps in June, but from a four year cycle low standpoint, here's the capitulation volume. This is the cluster where I see the four year cycle low. This here to me is basing its accumulation and you can see the strength that seems to be building up here. First of all, the RSI is at its highest level since the 2017 top. Some of my cycle indicators here showing that we may be peaking for the short term at least, but we're seeing a lot of extra strength that you would not normally see during a bear market. We also have one, two, three, four, five, six weeks now above a 10 week moving average with a decent amount of separation between the 10 week moving average and where we stand today. Every time in the past we had a cycle high. So these arrows still represent the daily 60 day cycle high. So they don't really correspond to the weekly chart that well, but they tell you where it happened on the weekly chart and you can see each of these cycle lows put us above the 10 week moving average, but only briefly. So three weeks here, two weeks here, one week, two weeks, perhaps barely here and not even here. Didn't make it above. Six weeks straight above the moving average is, it's telling, I think. I think it's telling us that we're at least accumulating. I think we're going to drop below that 10 week moving average. Of course, we always do even in a bull market, see this, right? And those are massive buying opportunities. I'm a little cautious though, because we are sort of the last time we saw any real sell off or real dump was back here in sort of December, January for timeframe and Bitcoin, even, you know, you see this even in the bull market, it has its periods, right? Every, every couple of months of dropping the, the February cycle low was very mild, really wasn't any, any real volatility. There were some price declines, but it was very, very, um, almost coordinated, um, or scripted. Nobody really got, uh, taking out any fast action. So I'm a little worried that we haven't seen any fast action sell off yet. And that's why, again, going back to the daily chart, I would love to see this. This would complete this daily chart very well. And actually I think it would do a really good job in shaking out a lot of people who are very speculatively, um, leveraged and confident. So something like that, and this chart would look quite normal. And then we can go back and test this big block that we saw all the way through the bear market, and then we can build a base in that area. Okay. Um, not the prettiest looking charts, but you get the point. Um, so this is what I want to see right now. I think now because we have six weeks above and near the cycle low that this December low holds at least for this April cycle low, I can't guarantee what happens in the June expected cycle low, but I think again, uh, not to be too repetitive, but I think we have that 40 cycle low in play. Let's look for, and let's hope that we see this drop. If we don't, and we see upside action, then I don't think it's the end of the world. I've talked about everybody having from a long-term perspective, a full boat, full load. I've been talking about a full load for two, three months. Now you don't want to market to surprise to the upside and leave you behind and not ever allowing you to have a full position. If you're invested in Bitcoin for the long-term, see its long-term benefits, believe that we will see this price and this price come back again in the future and exceed it. Then don't mess around with a hundred, five hundred or a thousand dollars right here per coin. Get your position before it's too late. Okay. So that's the Bitcoin wrap up. I'm going to go through now over some of the altcoins very briefly, because we do that on Friday mostly, but I'm going to go over the ones I like and the ones I'm positioned in. I have issued a few alerts that have gone really well recently. So I want to cover those as well. Okay. Starting off with ADA. I'm sitting in a really big profit position right here. Did not hit my second profit target of 1800. Came very close. Came within 17 Satoshi. We just need to be patient. It's pulled back now. Pulled back a little bit, not a huge amount. It's still above the 10 day moving average, still trending higher. I want to give it some room. My stop is still down this on this wick here. I do want to get it up. I want to get it up to here pretty soon, but I'm just giving a little more room. See how it goes over the next sort of 24 hours. If it gets to 1800, I'm already out. Um, and we'll get out on that position of the second, third of that, that is letting the rest ride. So this still looks good. This is a big winner so far. I want to make sure it remains a good winner. Obviously, if it gets back to the stop, we're going to give back a good amount of the profits, but still have a healthy profit position. And that's why I'm eager to get this up pretty soon. Maybe up to this 1580 area, maybe slightly, slightly lower, below, below that, but somewhere in that area is what I'm looking for. Look at the ADA and the weekly chart as well. Nice rounded bottom at this point, right in this area here. Okay. Now we're seeing strong volume and we're seeing four straight weeks higher. Um, very strong technicals looks really good, doesn't it? So it looks like it could make it all the way back. Uh, this was my original kind of best case scenario. That's huge, obviously 4,100, but, um, and I wouldn't be in position by then, I don't think, but somewhere in this area is where am I looking for, for my second or sort of the final third of my position. That's where I'm kind of looking forward to get out around about 26, uh, 25, 50 to sort of maybe 3000 area is what I'm looking for. Let's take another, yeah, probably the peak, probably the top of that right there, those two candles there and the top of this one here is what I'm looking for, but this looks pretty good. So just give it some time, be patient. Um, it's already gone up quite a bit of the last sort of three weeks. So gotta be, gotta be patient in general with these. Okay. Long Litecoin. Litecoin has dropped a little lower, um, but still above my stop point. Just have to just keep an eye on this, this, this no longer is valid. Um, but keep doing that. There you go. Uh, that line there, um, look, just respecting, respecting the uptrend in general, respecting the fact that it consolidates and then moves higher, hoping it still does this. And if it doesn't, then the stop is not too bad on this one here, uh, fairly tight overall, but, um, this is what we're looking at for Litecoin. Just give it some, give us some time and some patience here. It has consolidated for a while. So if it's going to continue this uptrend, it's going to go higher pretty soon. Posted a new alert again. We've been following Qtun for the longest time. Um, so this one here, it's broken out. It's really, I mean, I drew this, this kind of trend line here weeks and weeks and weeks ago. It's kind of moved like that. Uh, it's now above sort of this breakout point. It may retest the breakout point. My stop's pretty far down this point. I may want to try and move it up soon, but I'm going to give it a little more time. Maybe another day. I would definitely have a stop update for you on the Wednesday's midweek update, but, um, this looks good. Give it some time. Give it some room. The upside potential here is pretty big. I would probably take profit on a 25% gain. And then we'll see from there what, uh, what happens after that. But, uh, this one looks promising to me, but again, some of these do end up failing. So we just have to respect what we get from a price standpoint. And lastly, my other position I'm long in is XMR or Monero. This is Monero versus the dollar, which I'm not in. I'm in versus BTC, but this looks like a very beautiful chart coming off, uh, this triangle here, broken, breaking out. And I've been following this for a while. And it's been on my watch list. I've been talking about it, but here it is nice move higher. Um, definitely, definitely look like the looks of this. I think it can move significantly higher, but it needs to create some separation. It had a nice move yesterday, the day before yesterday, had a nice move kind of yesterday and overnight. So let's see if we can get some more upside from here. Um, and just give it some time, give it some room at the moment. My stop is right here on this candle, but I want to quickly rapidly move it to the breakout point as well. Probably just below today's current candle. Uh, once it gets some separation, maybe tomorrow, um, if you can go a little higher, move up those stops quickly, but this one looks good. I think this one has now the potential because it does have a December low as well. So it's been consolidating for quite a bit of time, as opposed to other coins that have been, that have February lows, for example, uh, this one looks really good and just have to be patient and just, just trust the chart. If it works, it's great. You want to be positioned and you want to hold the position. If it doesn't work, then you know, let your risk management take over from there as well. Okay. My friends, that's the wrap up. I think this is exciting. I think we've, I think if you're here, you've been patient, you have, um, you've weathered the majority of the bear market, not to say that we're not going to have difficult times ahead. We may have them in the next week. Like I see show here. Uh, but overall you've gone through the worst of this bear market. You've gone through the majority of the time. I would suspect I think it's only going to look more positive going forward. I think the second half of 2019 is going to be phenomenal. Stick with it. Um, stay patient and keep learning and keep, um, keep, you know, using the right trade and risk management practices and you will be just fine. Thanks very much for listening comments in the section below. Happy to answer anything you post. Thank you.", "source": "episode-2019-04-01"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-03-29?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Friday morning, the 29th of March here in New York. I hope you're all doing really well. I hope you're looking forward to a good weekend. Before we get there though, here is your weekly lightning report. This is the weekly segment where I pretty much go over around about 30 coins in the watch list, take a quick look at the chart and have a look to see if there's anything interesting going on or any opportunity on any one of those charts and basically give you my feedback on what I see on the chart. Now, the disclaimer here is that again, as always, I am looking at some of these charts for the first time in a week since the last report. Some I am introducing for the first time and in general, you're getting analysis pretty much on the fly so you need to take that for where it's coming from. If it's something I really like, I'll obviously point that out. If there's a position I'm in, I'll let you know. Otherwise, some of the analysis is going to be very quick and kind of dirty in some ways, right? Quick and dirty analysis that for the most part may not be relevant to you. So let's get stuck into it. Of course, we're going to start with Bitcoin and here we have day 51 of the cycle. We have not turned over as I thought we would by now. We have now made a new high for the second half of the cycle. Still have not taken out the day 18 high. So that's not overall anything significant, not all that bullish. What I mean by that is day 51 and we still haven't made a new high. So 51 days higher from the last low, almost two months and yet we can't get above day 18 high. So I think we're running out of time. We're running out of time. I have said before, if we surprise to the upside, I will not chase the move. I will rely on a cycle to come back and form a low probably above or right at that line here, which is kind of resistance or should be resistance. So if we break higher and come back down, that's where I would want to buy. I just won't chase the move. Fortunately, I mean, I'm trading futures and my positions are already essentially in Bitcoin, not kind of an excuse for not taking a rally, but just basically saying when it gets to the upside, when I'm not expecting it, it's not a huge deal for me. I just, I'm happy to let it go and just watch and look for an ideal opportunity to get back in. It's on the short side on the hedge or being short side that I really want to be taking advantage of or being a part of when it happens. So what I think it might be happening here, and I mentioned this, this probably is from the Wednesday report. I said, we should exceed the candles here, but probably not the day 18 high. I think the day 18 high stays in place, kind of get into the zone, run out of room, um, right out of, um, you know, um, buying pressure or buying support and then start to come down. The question then becomes, if we come down, where does that cycle low begin or where does it end? I should say, where does it form? Um, being that it's day 51 of the cycle, we are running shorter and shorter on days and that timing window that we have here is now pretty much upon us. There's only two days left. I've drawn the, the, I've drawn the timing window to begin on the 31st of March and kind of end around the 24th. Of course, plenty of time for Bitcoin to just slam down quickly. We know that, but still looking for and encouraged by the fact that we're holding on for so long in this cycle without a collapse that if we do, or when we do get a drop like this, that again, we're going to either double bottom off the February cycle low, or we're going to double bottom off the December low, which I think at the moment still stands as the four year cycle low. So if we can double bottom off this here, this becomes a solid $1,000 drop. It's around 20%. That's going to scare a lot of people. That's going to get the bears thinking that there's a continuation of the bear market. It's pretty much everything we need, which is pretty much a capitulation sell off into the cycle low, double bottom off the four year cycle low, and then we can move higher again. I think that's neat. It's perfect. Of course, in markets and trading, nothing is ever neat and perfect. So we need to be aware of that. Um, again, the difficulty here for me, and I think it's going to be for almost everybody is that we're trendless where, you know, we're moving sideways overall. And, um, you know, and, and those sort of trendless markets, it's difficult to get a sort of a good position established and, you know, and trading it longer or trading it for, uh, you know, for training for that trend. Cause there just, there's no trend at this point. Um, obviously you don't want to be short yet. I mean, I took one, one short, one short shot at this only I took, and that was because I saw a breakdown here and a good spot in the, in the cycle. It didn't happen. Now I'm very much patient. I want to pretty much see a swing high at top and then a confirmation that it's moving back lower before looking at another short opportunity. Okay. So that's the update for Bitcoin. Pretty similar to the update I gave on Wednesday and Monday, the difference being that we have kind of this move now deep into the cycle into this area here. Let's see how it reacts. I think a lot of people are getting a little excited here, especially the last couple of days. So I think that's going to push the long interest, meaning the amount of people that are leveraged long, uh, much higher in a more precarious position and very few shorts are active at the moment. So I think from a contrarian standpoint, we are ready and in the right position for a move lower. Again, just be mindful. If it goes higher, that's, that's a possibility at this point. So let's move on to the list of coins that we have and we normally follow. All right. So ADA has been a really nice trade for me. I have a good size position, position on this one, working out really well. Um, no real threat at this point. Every little drop seems to be, um, recovered and then rallies higher. It looks like overnight, we had another good move up to around about 1733, 1800 is my second profit target, um, to take profit on the second, third of the position, 33% already been taken. A 1800 is the 33%, second 33%. And then the rest, we ride. What I have done is moved the stop up to here. So it's right below this candle here in this wick, which is a little bit of a hammer looking candle. Uh, so that the stop is around about 1450, just below the 1480, the bottom of this 1450 gives us some room. I think anything below 1450 at this point is a danger spot. It means that's the site. The means that this chart is probably topped at this point. Why, why stay long and give up all your profits at that point. Um, the second entry was just out of this breakout. So this would be a nice profit still, uh, around about 10% on a stopout. So not bad for a stopout to get a 10% on one position and around about 30% or 40% profit in the second position. So that's where we stand on ADA overall still looks good. I mean, we still, you know, still moving higher, nice neckline breakout, but certainly this green line here is kind of where the extent of the inverse head and shoulders ends at that point, we could get a good pullback as well. So looking carefully at this, um, as always, I want to move up my stops as fast as I can. If we can get another move higher, then this comes up again and up again. That's the way I play it. I want to, um, I want to preserve my, my profit that I have in there, but give it room to breathe and to move higher as well. Arc seems to be still kind of flagging here, consolidating this move. Um, bias for me is still to the upside. I said, if you went long, this is your stop. I would almost say now, if you're long, move up your stop, make it nice and tight, slightly below 3% below kind of the bottom of the candles here that gives you some more breathing room as well. Um, but this still looks like it can, it's kind of like forming a W, um, bottom consolidation here. I think it can still move higher, but again, you don't want to be caught, um, long if it starts breaking down. So that's why I suggest something like that for a stop. Air swap also looks pretty good. Um, it's, it's kind of made new highs. It looks like since last lightning report, got some good strength. I think this is definitely a, uh, a long candidate. If you've been following this, uh, the chart looks good. Let's make the bottom of that base there, the stop point as well. Um, anything below that is not good news. Um, but still it looks like it's in an uptrend now, nice bottom here over three months or so. And now it looks like it could move considerably higher from this point. There's plenty of room in this one as well for maybe a move up to 1800. So that's good opportunity there for sure. ABC. So Bitcoin cash, not a whole lot, kind of broke out of a sort of a downtrend here, but not doing a whole lot at the moment. Um, don't really like this setup too much, so I can't recommend it at this point. Satoshi's vision, Bitcoin cash SV flatlined, not doing anything I like at all at this point. Binance coin still looking strong. Um, but it has broken. No, I wouldn't say broken, but, uh, the kind of what I was talking about this trajectory, getting ever more vertical with each move would have to kind of make it like this now. Um, so threatening to kind of break down at this point, but still above a 10 day moving average. So still valid, uh, uptrend in my opinion, still looks pretty strong. Uh, I think anything below this red line is a breakdown in that trajectory. Otherwise I think you stay long. So it does support even a kind of a move, uh, lower at this point to sort of there and then a continuation that's also possible. Obviously then the challenge then becomes that, right? So that doesn't look like a continuation of sort of this uptrend that gets ever steeper. Still, we have to respect this uptrend overall. Uh, I think really to be bullish, you want to stay above this 10 day moving average, keep the trend going. So you want to be more something like this. Um, and that kind of supports kind of gets supported better, um, at this point, but still overall uptrend stick with trends. Uh, don't go against trends, either be with a trend or be sidelined, never go against a trend. Of this nature. So it still looks good. Bits, bit shares has a similar pattern to many of the old coins kind of a rounded bottom over two or three month period. I think if the whole all coin space is still going higher than all of these types of charts will continue higher overall, that look pretty good. The question is, how do you trade something like this? There isn't a clean, um, sort of setup pattern. I think you can go long and to kind of find some spots if you like this coin, uh, or if you'll, you know, if you like following it, these are the type of charts where you just got to pick, pick your spot and stick with the trend and hope that the trend is going to continue higher at this point, but they all have all these types have similar structures. So they have to be played in a very similar way for me. I don't trade these types of, um, uh, these types of setups because they're really not a clean setup. It's not a, not like a, uh, a head and shoulders or a, some sort of triangle pattern. It's more of a rounded bottom so they can get noisy and chop you out of position as well. So I don't, don't necessarily find a tradable position here, but overall I think these, these do have a bottom potential in them. Civic coin is another one that looks kind of similar to what I just showed you on bit shares, very similar rounded bottom pattern over a few months. Looks like they want to go higher. Some of them have some big spikes like this. Again, the same type of, view here is that if alter going higher, then these will just keep going like this. If alter not going higher, of course we're going to end the top, then these will all fail. These types of patterns will all fail. So again, pick your points and pick the one you like the most. For example, you know, this one here has a little bit, a little bit more of a setup because you've got this sort of, um, consolidation, almost like a flag or pennant type pattern. So these do give you an opportunity to at least define your risk, maybe below this candle right here. So you've got, uh, kind of like a 10% drop in, uh, in, in your risk. Um, you know, your risk level, for example, whereas the other one probably didn't have that. So that's just something to look out for. I like to find little, little points on a chart that makes sense to me where if it drops below, then the patterns negated, the uptrend is no longer in play. And that's what I use for me as a stopping point. So those types of, um, those types of positions on a chart give me the opportunity to define an entry at least and define my trade size. Dash here is looking pretty good. Um, looks like it has a bottom in December, so it's got a decent looking chart pattern. Not sure if there's necessarily a trade in this, but, um, I think if you like Dash from a sort of longterm perspective, it's kind of falling off the radar lately, but if you like it, it's probably a good entry here. This looks like it may have bottomed a couple of points here that could act as sort of a stopping point. This one here would be the most conservative one. And then you could, if you want to get really aggressive on a trade, sort of get in on this sort of stop here and hope that it's kind of like consolidating, going higher, consolidating, going higher. Seems like it has that one up two up three. So that can continue going in that sort of step up fashion. That would be a stop in that case. Engine coin here. It looks like it has finally topped and now, uh, has a pretty, pretty classic looking, uh, sort of top pattern here. So you've got this big spike, good size drop, then a three quarter way move back up that fails. And then now we kind of have below this area here. So making new lows, I think this goes down, retraces probably back to this area here at some point, quite a far move lower. I think if you were trading this and you were taking, taking this long uptrend, you want to be out at this point. You don't want to be risk, um, it coming all the way back down. I have a position in this longterm. I did clean up some of it on this move higher because it just moved too far, too fast. But I do like it from a longterm standpoint still and hold on regardless of what the chart is telling me on the short term. Yeah. EOS looks pretty good here. We, um, we have this break of the neck line talked about that came back. I drew this line and I think it might've been last week talking about that would be a stop point, um, on this up trend. Looks like now we have come out of this consolidation period from this big move. Maybe that made another move. This to me looks like it's going to keep going higher at this point. So this is the type of chart I do like, even though now it might be a little stretched, maybe a little overboard. I do like kind of this con this type of chart, um, where it's just making steps higher. It's trending higher. It now has the makings of a new sort of prolonged uptrend as well. So, uh, this one here for me is a long candidate. If you like EOS, uh, stick with it. The trend is there. Here's your stop point. You may want to now move up your stop point to here. So keep moving up that stop point guys. I keep reinforcing that move up your stops, move up your stops, but make them reasonable enough. We're not getting chopped out of position unnecessarily, right? They always have to be, um, tight, but only tight where they make sense, where you're giving your setup and your pattern enough room to breathe and move higher. ETC on the other hand is not something I like. We do have a December low. We held the lows in February, but overall not doing, not doing much that I care for at this point. Um, I, this is an avoid for me. I just don't see where the trade is, unfortunately. So here's Ethereum. This one's important. Um, not doing anything at all, just chopping sideways. Um, so Bitcoin is just too much strength and this is not, this is not outperforming where normally when Bitcoin is doing well, Ethereum outperforms right now. It's just matching the performance of Bitcoin. And that's why you see this stable here. I think if Bitcoin does turn lower, this will underperform Bitcoin and therefore against, against Bitcoin, Ethereum would drop. Don't know where to, but I think maybe a test of the February lows is what I'm looking for. And then a nice move higher perhaps, but not much strength here overall, even, even though a lot of the old coins do look like to have more relative strength or holding up pretty well, Ethereum is not. So that's a little bit of my concern, uh, for the entire space in general, but this for me is not a long, not at this point. Um, I think it becomes a good long at the, at the coming cycle low for Bitcoin. Go chain is, um, well, it's starting to fall back down now. Um, if you kind of bought maybe a mini break here, um, um, considering getting out now, a 10 day moving average has turned down. Price is one, two, three, four, five days below the 10 day moving average. For me, this is now a sell at this point. So adding Grin for the first time, uh, Grin actually, I do mine this by, um, if you didn't know, I do a little bit of mining on the side, mostly just from three GPUs on a souped up, um, server that I have. Um, but I do mine gin. Uh, I like gin. Sorry. I keep saying gin. Grin. Um, I've got, I've got alcohol in my mind. Um, so Grin, um, I do like this. Uh, I think it has potential overall, um, but it has been sold off pretty significantly for quite, uh, quite some weeks, if not months could be forming a little bottom here. I don't know. It's a little early to tell, but, uh, the 10 day moving average has sort of smoothed out. It seems like it may want to form a low. I think if it can get above this line here, it has a potential for a reversal and a move higher, but at this point it's still on the watch list. H O T flattening out, um, judging by the wicks here, not a whole lot of, uh, movement or volume, still only 28 Satoshi. So yeah, this is like a penny stock, um, but good structure here. This could be sort of, well, no, this is, this could be almost a decilient triangle forming as well. Um, even though it's not clean, but this looks like it could be continuation because you've got this nice move higher. Um, key is going to be how, how, how it reacts down the bottom here. So if it breaks below this 26 level 25, get out, but if it can kind of move out and break out a little bit, this could move higher and double or triple easily from this point. This is not the type of coin I buy for example, but, um, this looks like it has, has potentially the way. So keep an eye on this one. Okay. Icon ICX. So this is one we had long a while ago and got out, and this is a perfect example of why I get out of coins that don't move. So we had nice trends up, up, up, and then it's just kind of just done nothing since now. It could still continue higher, but for me, 10 day moving average is now moving much lower prices below it in general. This to me looks like it's starting to head back lower. No reason to be long this anymore, even though, um, even though it could still, you know, move high and go again. The, the, for me, the initial reason for getting into this trade, uh, is done with, and from a new fresh perspective, I don't see it at this point as a, as a long opportunity, even though again, you've got kind of a February low, you've kind of got a base or a bottom, and this could be an uptrend. I just don't see the long trade in the short term for me. Self key again, same like last week bottom, uh, you know, just running along the bottom, not a whole lot to see here. I want to see some evidence that it wants to go higher before looking to get anything, uh, anything long this one. LISC looks decent, um, February low, no December low, but still had a bit of a breakout. It's come back down. Um, it looks like it could be sort of, you know, consolidating again before moving higher. I'm not sure if you're getting long on this one, but if you are long from earlier, then clearly this is your stop right now. Um, and you may want to start to consider moving that up pretty quickly to that point there. Um, but you may want to give a little more, a bit more room for the time being, but this looks like it could go higher, but it's a could be right. A lot of charts look like they could go higher. It's a matter of, um, will it? Um, so yep, just keep an eye on this one. If you're long, stay long. Okay. Litecoin probably the best looking chart of all huge, beautiful uptrend, moves higher consolidation moves, high consolidation. We have a running consolidation here. That's moving higher. I think even though it's sort of breaking down a little bit today, I think this is, uh, if the whole sector is still moving higher, Litecoin looks like it's going to go again. It looks like it can easily do another one of these types of moves. Okay. So let's take that and kind of put it up there. That's the type of potential it has. It did something kind of similar here. If you look at it, did something kind of similar, not so much here, but you get the point. It's looking like these consolidations, um, give way to another move higher. So that's what I'm looking at here. I'm now I'm, I'm long this, but I'm long again, uh, with a little more position based on this area here. I'm not sure if I actually put a trade alert out for that. So I'm going to check that to make sure I did. If not, then I will issue one, but essentially now we're looking at, um, here it is here, looking at this candle here as the stop. And we want to get that up fairly quickly to that bottom candle right there. So that's what I'm looking at for light coin. Mana coin. Well, hello, look at that. That's a massive spike, uh, up to the top of that channel. And you eventually would do that, but not in one day. That's just huge. That's almost a 40, 50% move. You do know, I hold this from a long-term perspective from a trade perspective. I don't see anything right now. The trade would have been down here to hold. It didn't look pretty even back then. So, uh, this for me is not an opportunity to go long from a trade standpoint. MKR, MKR, um, looks like last week I had said it was forming kind of a breakout or consolidation to break out. It did slightly break out. I said this would be a stop looking, uh, looking like it might break down to stop out now at this point. Don't necessarily like this. Uh, I wouldn't be going in long for this. Um, trend is higher overall, but don't like the fact that it's kind of tried to make a move. Now it's moving back below as well. So I'd be cautious on this. If you're still long this and then stay long, I think though, all these, but the bottom of all these candles here, which kind of have the same price, uh, 0.16, I think that is definitely a stop point, which is not too far below. OMG. Yeah. This looks really nice. Look at this uptrend. Um, just moving kind of like, as I've been outlining, just, um, you know, kind of like light coin, but on a shorter timeframe here, it's going up, consolidating, going up, consolidating. It looks like it's consolidated again. This is a, if you're long this stay long, uh, you can almost put in a new trend line kind of like this, keep it honest to their moving averages above it. Uh, anything below that is a get out, but this point stayed long. Uh, you can even get long. I'm not sure where you stop is based on this. Um, that's too far down to use this candle, but thing is it's, it's definitely moving higher with a nice solid uptrend and fairly vertical as well. So this is a good looking chart. Oh, NT is a good looking chart as well. We have a December low, nice move higher, um, stepping up, stepping up. So it looks like, so let's take a look at this. It looks like it came back here to sort of test. That's well, drop below that. That's a good shakeout right there. Came back down, uh, tested these two peaks right here, moved up, came back down. Now it looks like it's, it needs to move higher at this point. Otherwise it stalls. So this is still, if you're long, stay long. Uh, this does not become, uh, so this probably is just stopped right now, right here, this bottom wick, it reversed on that. That was a stop out. Okay. That was the shake out from the long. Now it needs to move higher. If it gets down again and gets back below that wick, then that's a top for sure. I would think, and then it moved back lower at this point though. This still looks pretty good. If it even gets closer to here, I might even buy this one. I like this looking chart. So, um, stay long and, uh, I'm going to keep this on my watch list for sure. I'm actually going to put in a alert on this one. If it drops back below that line, I will probably add, um, to my position. Let me see. Okay. Qtum. Now this one here, I've been following, I've been tracking, I've been tweeting this out. This one looks a lot like the ADA chart just weeks behind. I've talked about that quite a bit, had a big move, broke the neckline on the same day. That's just, uh, probably more speculative or spam type volume. Uh, that's to be ignored, but now we're building this base. It's kind of a retest here. Almost another retest come back down. I think once this breaks this neckline and I've got an alert set, this one here is definitely a long trade opportunity, and this one could easily move up to kind of 2000 area. So this one could easily double is what I'm saying from this point. I want to see more of a breakout first before doing that, but keep this one on your watch list, make an alert. This one is the type of trade that you should be looking to do yourself for sure. Raven coin continues to surprise parabolic like structure. Definitely thought this was a top. It's moved. Definitely thought this might've been a top. It's still going higher at this point. I don't know how to get in at this point. For me, these are just way too advanced for me to even want to get in. I think in the past, but every time I tried to get into something like this, that's exactly when it topped. Um, so I'm happy to just watch people ride this one. Uh, ultimately 10 day moving average is nice and tight. That could be a stopping point as well. I don't know what to tell you. Otherwise, you know, this is just too vertical for my liking. Um, it's just, you know, if you've, if you've, if you've been riding this, I think very few people have, if you've been able to ride this and stay long, then you'd know, you probably know better than me on how to handle your position from this point. Cause you've managed to stay long up until this point. So keep it going. Stratus not doing much kind of moving on the bottom. It did have that nice move. It did nothing. It's come all the way back down. Have an alert set. I'm not even sure if I want to do anything on that type of alert. That's just kind of let me know that it's doing something. Um, yeah, this one is not interesting to me at the moment. Theta is a, wow, that's not looking good at all. This is definitely retracing back. Definitely topped massive fake out here. Uh, false breakout came all the way back and has completely shaking people out. If you went long this and you're still holding, then I'm not sure what you're doing. You need to be out of this, uh, even though this can, can certainly reverse at any time. This is not a pretty looking chart. It looks like it has definitely topped, could be heading much lower as well. Tron looks like it wants to build it is building a base. It looks like it wants to eventually at some point kind of break out. Um, but it's not doing that yet. So, um, question is if it can get above this line, then we may be interested, right? Um, but this needs to be up a little more. Uh, otherwise there's no real trade to be had here, but it looks like it could be trying to maybe test it one more time, come back for the cycle low, and then maybe make a move higher. Vibe looks similar to many coins, kind of around the bottom. Good thing about it is it has a September low. Um, but not sure where the entry is just yet at this point. I think we want to see a move higher. Um, nothing of real significance, maybe something up here kind of, right. Um, and then sort of something like that. Keep an eye on it. Um, don't, don't like anything at this point. I just think it needs more development, more time to, uh, to get excited on this one. So if the coin has consolidated, I did talk about kind of it moving higher. This would be sort of the point where it would want to go up again. If not, it starts to break down, could go along here. You could use the candle right there as your stop point. Anything below that sort of breaks the, breaks the pattern. See how you've got this consolidation and then a move higher that could be doing the same thing right now, similar here, but a breakdown below is trouble and a reason to get out. But so overall, this looks pretty good because there is a little bit of history now of it coming out and forming and moving higher as well. So it's not in the, one of those pre pre move stages. It actually is already moving. So could respect the small trend that's developed here as well. XLM Stella don't like this. It had a nice move. It could go higher again, but I just don't like the fact that everybody's sort of selling and giving away Stella for free. So, um, I think it's kind of jumped the shark, so to speak with all the free giveaways. Don't like that. Um, and I don't like much on this chart, to be honest with you. Monero, um, still chopping sideways, looking for that next move. I think this is going to be pretty big once it moves, but the problem is it could be a continuation lower. It could also be kind of a, not normally wouldn't be, but it could be a sort of bottom reversal as well in the making. We'll just have to wait and see on this one and just keep an eye on it. I think I've been really, really right on Ripple. This is just a downtrend at some point. This sort of decline may begin to accelerate. I think coming down to kind of this bottom trend line area here is a big possibility at this point. So it's around about another 30% drop from here, but yeah, I think this can just continues down lower and then maybe you can get another move higher as well. Hard to say, but this is just very bearish overall. I know a lot of people are fans of Ripple. A lot of people are not fans of Ripple. It's love or hate for Ripple. Um, definitely not looking pretty at the moment. Tezos continues to move higher. Nice move, consolidation, moving again. This one has the potential to keep going and going and going. Um, again, not one of the ones, not, not the type of chart you can just say, I want to get long and not risk a lot. So that's where it's at the moment. Um, if we get a consolidation back again, then you can look at sort of buying maybe in some, that something that looks like this, but at the moment it's not a buy for me. XVG looks like a nothing at the moment along the bottom here. Needs to see some upside action to get remotely excited about this one. For me, does not look like a chart I want to be involved with. Similar again on ZEC or Zcash, not looking good. March lows. I want to be avoiding this. This looks like a massive continuation lower at some point. Certainly if the Bitcoin cycle breaks down, this is going to get smashed in my opinion. Horizon or Zen is one of the ones I had put an alert out for. I think the trend is still higher. Still looks decent, although it's starting to roll over a little bit. It's not really moving higher. It needs to make a move very soon in my opinion. This is a stop for sure. Needs to make a move soon. Otherwise it's going to roll over and just fizzle out. So just keep an eye on this. But if you went long on my alert, you're still up. And I think even this stop point here would be a profit. So stay long and see where it takes us. Closing out with 0x or ZRx is the symbol. Again, not a whole lot. It showed some promise. It broke above this kind of line here, which for me indicated potentially a bottom and reversal. But my problem with ZRx is it has a March low, not a February, not a December low, but a March low. So it needs to do a lot more to really convince me to get long, something like this. And I think the best case was to get back to this declining trend line and then potentially be rejected at that point and move lower. So I just want to keep an eye on this. Don't like too much about it yet. Although a little constructive with this move higher, still want to see it and continue that trend or that move higher before starting to see validation that we have a new trend or an uptrend in play. My friends, thank you very much for listening. Remember, patience is the key in trading. Don't overcommit. Don't just take any old trade because somebody on Twitter says they're buying it. Make sure that you understand why you're buying something. It's okay to go off somebody's advice or somebody's idea. Absolutely. I mean, that's what we're doing here to some extent, but they still have to make sense to you and your style. So when you see a setup, you need to be able to recognize what the person's telling you or why they're doing it. And for you to be able to think, well, yeah, that makes sense to me. I can see it. That's my style. Um, and then you kind of get to own it as well by just putting a trade on simply because somebody else is telling you, you don't know what they're thinking. You are not in their shoes. You want to know how to get out for profit. You want to know how to get out for risk to stop out or, you know, to sell out to minimize risk. You won't have the ownership you need to own and be successful to trade. So number one rule, you need to own the trade, even if it's not your idea. Okay. Um, again, any comments, put them in the, in the post below, I will answer as many as I can, as quick as I can. I check through the weekend always, I'm always answering. So if you answer, ask a question, check back in a day or two days, I will eventually get an answer on that question for you. Again, thanks for being here. Have a great weekend. All the best to you.", "source": "episode-2019-03-29"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-02-21?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas. It is around midday here in New York on Thursday. I hope you're all doing really well. I have a brand new mic set up. I bought a pretty high-end sort of podcaster set up. So I'm hoping that the sound quality has improved greatly with this. It was a significant investment. And another announcement is that I will be away for four days visiting Texas with a few friends, leaving tomorrow morning and getting back on Monday night. So I will not have an update beyond this one until Tuesday of next week. So five days from now. If I do find some downtime and if I do see any action in the markets while I'm away, I do have my laptop and I probably will get on board and do an alert. I may even do a surprise update as a post. Just letting you know, however, that don't be surprised if you do not see an update until Tuesday. So let's go into Bitcoin here and see if we have any updates to kind of the analysis I presented on Tuesday. Firstly, a few people sort of seem to be a little concerned. I've seen it in the emails. I've seen it on Twitter on what this pullback means. And when I look at the chart, I really don't see a pullback. I see a sideways move. And I think all that means is that we are consolidating this big candle here launched as we kind of did before that. And that is kind of normal if the cycle is moving higher at this point to get a sideways move back into the Bollinger Bands and get ready for kind of the next move. So that is nothing to be concerned about. Again, the only thing I do want to be a little concerned about is the fact that we're already up to day 15. And, you know, we are about $500, $600 off the bottom, the cycle low. Now, that's not a lot. But when you consider that this move here wasn't, it certainly was better than what we've got so far. But this itself was only a nine day move. And if I go in and get my profit tool, I think I had it before, didn't I? Price range. Okay, so, you know, we had a 35% rally here to the peak. And let's see what we have currently. Nothing close just yet. But we do have a 20% move already off the bottom in 15 days. Not a whole lot. It would be the going back over time, it would be kind of the least amount that we've seen, I believe. Maybe this one here over 27 days was less of a rally. But when you look at the past cycles, you'll see that these were, these were much bigger rallies earlier in the bear market. In fact, each one appears to have only had a significantly less rally as the bear market progressed. So there's a chance here that we still, you know, we're still in a bear market, you know, there's, we think, well, I think that this cycle might have been the bear market low. But I don't know, I don't have any confirmation just yet, because I don't have at least one higher high to pin my hopes on. All I have right now is one lower, sorry, one higher low at this point, really want to see a move. Let me remove that. I really want to see a move above the December 24th candle to get even remotely excited about this being a bear market low. So we just have to be a little cautious here. Obviously, I'm long, I'm long with decent amount of size, in fact, too. But I'm not married to the position in the sense that if it does break down from this point, and continue some type of bear market deep into March and April, and deep below the $3,000 level, I would be surprised, to some extent, but not shocked, right, because we are in this downtrend. And markets are just cruel like that. You can have one viewpoint, and you should always have a viewpoint that, especially if you're trading or have a position, you should be fairly confident or comfortable in that position, but you should also be prepared for the alternative scenario. And without that real, you know, bottoming confirmation at the moment, I'm still in my back of my mind saying, okay, where can I be wrong? And where I could be wrong is when I first see a break below, back below this level, I wouldn't necessarily be wrong there. I'd be a little worried, but I'd be wrong here at that blue line here, which is kind of this cluster. Anything below that really negates this high, high, high sort of process, right? We really want to kind of get, let's actually draw it from here. So this is kind of the first high of the cycle. This is the first sort of low. Here's the next high we just put in. So really in theory, you want to have the next kind of low form above this line here. And that's why I say breaking below that line, I start to get a little worried. I may even take some of the extra leverage that I have, take that off. But below this line here, I'm pretty much out and I'm gone. I may even be considering shorting at that point, certainly shorting below this line here, because that now is our cycle low. So really, I haven't, having much of an update for you since Tuesday's update, I went into pretty, pretty good detail on Tuesday. I advise you to, to look back over that video again, if you did, if you missed it for whatever reason, or if you just want to refresh on where I stand. This is kind of the same action. This is just two or three candles moving sideways. It doesn't negate the bullish narrative. It doesn't make it any more bearish in any way. And I think if I flip over to some of the other charts, let's look at Ethereum to the dollar, same type of thing. We, you know, we rallied two big bars, that's great. And that is a 10, more than 10, 50, almost 20% move. So to see three candles moving sideways, that's perfectly normal, perfectly healthy. Ethereum to Bitcoin, again, this is, this is looking like a flag. That's bullish as well. Litecoin, I think it's going to show the, well, Litecoin's even more bullish because it's still, it has more rapidly expanding Bollinger Bands and price is moving and testing the upper Bollinger Bands as it expands. So Litecoin continues for me to show some good strength, even though it's down, you know, 8% right here. That's normal when you've got an asset like this that really likes to push the boundaries on the upside and the downside as well. Excuse me. One update is the Monero position I had, I know, stopped out. So we had a stop at break even, didn't lose anything. And this is a perfect example on how I sort of try and attempt to trade all the time. I don't like losing on my trades. And this one gave me an opportunity when it broke out to put in a stop at the break even point. And I did, it almost came back and tested here. Then it rallied well. I thought, okay, well, this is a chance now. This may actually prove to be a good trade. And then it's reversed since. And now it's down, right? So if you got into this position, you should be out and you should be out break even, no harm, right? No foul. Getting out break even is great. There was no reason to let it come back and result in a loss because it had some decent gains early on as well. So that's just one good lesson on how I trade and system advice for you. Pull up your stops as fast as you can, especially when the position affords you that opportunity. Get up there and start closing that gap because, yes, even though your risk is defined. So when you get into a trade, you say to yourself, I want to risk, let's just say for argument's sake, 1% of my capital. You define what that risk point is and you go into the trade. So that's your worst case. It should be your worst case. But that's still 1%, right? Why give up 1% if you can get away with raising the stop if it does not impact the overall objective of the trade? And so what I mean by that is if you get in right away to a trade and you have your defined stop and you have your profit target, you're not going to raise that stop almost immediately unless you get some good cushion on the profit side, paper profit side. So if a trade is moving forward and progressing like you expected it, then you can start to bring up the bottom. It doesn't have to go all the way to break even right away, but you can start to bring it up and start to narrow that 1% risk gap that you defined early on. So even if it means risking half a percent halfway through the trade, that's great. It's better than 1%. But when the trade gets to the point where it's showing some positive action, then you start to say to yourself, well, if it reversed here, I went back below my entry, is it still the setup that I envisioned when I first got in? That's the question you always have to ask yourself. Is it going to invalidate the setup even by going back below my entry? And if the answer is yes, and I think it will be a lot of the time, then that's when you want to be saying to yourself, okay, well, if it's going to invalidate the original goal of the trade, then pull up my stop, right? Getting out with break even losses often, you'll find that it actually feels pretty good to not be losing on some of these trades. And then when the good one comes along, you're going to let it ride and it's going to be a good winner for you. So it's just a little bit of a tip for you today, considering the markets aren't doing too much, throwing a little kind of lesson of how I like to trade and pull up my stops as fast as possible. But of course, you all know you must have a stop on any position. Don't let any position ruin your portfolio, ruin your capital. There's been many cases where I've had emails or questions from members and they say something like, well, I'm in XYZ position and I really love it. It's great. I can see it's going to be good, but I'm down 18% on the position and I went all in or I went in with half my capital. So they're down 10% of their overall position and they still believe in it, but they're too deep into the position now, too deep into a loss to want to realize that loss. And realizing a loss is not the end of the world because you're working on hope that it's going to recover. If the original thesis for getting into the trade has now busted and it's gone, why the hell are you going to be in the trade? Just get out and live another day, take your loss, take your medicine, put it down as a lesson and experience and then move on. But the lesson there is never let a trade get away from you. There's always going to be another one. There'll be another one tomorrow and the day after the next week and next month. Don't get married to a position and to want a single idea because once it gets away from you without a stop, you're going to find it very hard to close that position as well. So now I'm going to quickly just go through some of the other coins to see if there's been any sort of update. ADA still looking constructive here. It's actually sort of come back to this 10 day moving average. I don't know if I want to position yet unless it sort of breaks above this trend line here, which is kind of like a neckline and inverse head and shoulders. I think if this breaks, then it's got some room to really move. Let's just see. It's, you know, it's got some room. So this may take a while to develop, but if it can kind of break above that, then I think it has the potential to at least get up into this sort of area here, which was a big cluster before breaking down in the bear market. So patience on this one. I don't see a reason necessarily getting in. The other option is, you know, I don't really love trend lines like this, but you could kind of get in here because it had dropped quite a bit and use this trend line as a stop. Not my cup of tea, but for some people it might be. And then let's go through the list here. XLM showing somewhat of a possible round of bottom. But again, I said that this one was not showing relative strength because it had recent lows as opposed to December lows. So I want to stay away from this one as well. And then Bitcoin SV or this one, I don't even want to bother with. It's just continuing lower. It didn't even show any type of bounce this last week and two weeks when everything else went higher. There was pretty much every asset, every coin on my list did something except for Bitcoin SV. So that really tells you and shows you just how weak and how underloved really this is. Binance coin, continued up strength, continued up trend. Too late for me. Trends too advanced at this point. But if you're in it, keep writing it. I mean, why not? Look at the 10, maybe use the 10 day moving average or slightly, maybe one or 2% below the 10 day moving average as a stopping point. Because when this comes back down, it probably will come down fairly quickly. It'll probably do something like, I tried to indicate the other day, but it'll probably do something like that. You know, come maybe back all the way to the lower Bollinger Band. So that's something to be aware of. But while the trend is up, and if you are positioned long for a trade, then stay with the trend. This is just giving and giving and giving. So let it keep giving until it really throws you off at that point. Although taking a little bit of profit is also advised at this point. Let's have a look what else we have. EOS, I think was doing really well. Yeah, look at that. EOS continues to move higher. I was talking about maybe buying a break, sorry, a downturn or turn back towards the breakout point. Looks like we might not get that at this point. But this is looking really strong. It's still outside the Bollinger Bands. So even a touch of the 10 day moving average as it increases might be a good trade. Or even a sharp pullback, say to this, you know, 8600, 8700 area would be a good time to go along at that point. But you can see it, December low, a bit of a wedge for the February Bitcoin equivalent cycle low and now a breakout. So this is really strong. You could also go along right here, to be honest with you and be prepared for a pullback, use a much smaller position size because you're going to have quite a bit of risk in this gap and have you stop right back here at the breakout point. That's a lot of, you know, it's probably around about, let's have a look what that is. So from this point here, it's around 14%. So 14% drop in the price means that you're really going to have a fairly small size, position size for it to only have a 1% or less risk on your portfolio. But still, it's still opportunity there. That takes out a lot of the noise and lets you kind of to say, you know what, all right, I'm willing to take a little bit of a pullback in case it keeps going higher and then have, you know, a decent spot where if it gets below at this point, it's most likely going to fail and keep going lower. EOS versus the dollar, I think is even just as good, looking probably just as strong. Let's see if we can pick up something like this. It must be an old line. Yeah, something like that. That's kind of like the breakout point there. So that's looking strong as well. And again, a pullback to 320, 330 is probably a buy at this point. And then, you know, you can find a spot that you like, maybe something like that. So around about the $3 area as kind of your risk. This is looking positive. This looks like it has room now to continue higher. And this may be a $5, back to a $5 coin again at some point. So another good 30% upside potential in this one as well. Again, do your own research. I'm giving you ideas here that maybe they fit your style. All I ask is that if you do any of these and by yourself, then of course, you practice the proper risk management and put in the right position. And just make, you know, don't just go into a trade because, hey, maybe that will go up. You know, it's got to fit your style and your system. And you've got to have an objective and a target. Let's see if I can find anything else here for you before closing out for the day. Manacoin. So Manacoin sort of broke out of somewhat of a trend here, downtrend, but has really reversed again. This one is not looking good. It's not something I bought. I do own it long term. But yeah, this one has also February lows as opposed to December lows. So still a lot of weakness here overall. Don't like this much at this. Don't like this at the moment. OMG broke out, failed to do anything, came back below. That could have been somewhat of a fake out. It might go from this point. Not something I necessarily love at this point, but still has some potential here for possible move higher. Now that it's broken out, kind of retested, but it hasn't really moved with any authority. So I'm not really liking that too much. Qtum. Yeah, it's got that inverse head and shoulders capability. It's got the relative strength that we've been looking for. It's got some tight Bollinger bands. It looked like it was breaking out. I think this one looks pretty good. At this point, at the 528 Satoshi level, the lows are 500. That's not bad. That's 5% drop to new lows. This could be an entry right here. I'm not taking it right now because, again, I'm traveling. But this could be an entry at this moment. I might even make an alert out of this. I'd like to see maybe a breakout first, a push higher before doing that. But the fact that the stop is pretty tight gives me some confidence that this actually may turn out to be a good trade after all. And then Raven Coin. Look at that. That's breaking down. Excuse me. This now is in kind of no man's land, uncharted territory. Yes, you've got that bar at the low. So let's move that even lower. But yeah, that's not looking good at the moment. This here is showing new lows for the last six, five months, is it? Yeah, about five month lows. Essentially lows for since inception. So this is not very good at all. Stay away from this one. Vertcoin, I have not covered in a long time. Let me see what this looks like. Vertcoin doesn't look too bad. Big spike up here. This one has really fallen off the radar, I think, as well. I think volumes are pretty light. There was obviously that double spend attack as well that happened multiple times. So yeah, this one is probably highly manipulated as well. So I'm not seeing much here. It's already done a big spike. It's already kind of come off the bottom. So nothing I'm really loving about that one. XLM I covered earlier. And now here we go with Ripple. Okay, so here we go. I didn't notice this. I should have had an alert on this. But this looks like it's coming down now to break below the head and shoulders. And we talked about the JP Morgan coin having possible negative impact on Ripple. This is definitely not a JPM development, but it just adds or compounds to it. You know, I'm not a believer in news. But this, let's have a look here. This is starting to break down. This is probably a short at this point. But you want to see a little more possible, a little more breakdown from that neckline before getting in. I think the general rule is kind of like 1% or 2% of a breakdown before getting really excited about a short. But this is definitely a short candidate right now. So that's something I'm going to write that down. It's something I may want to take a trade on myself. XRP. All right. And then let's have a look what else we have. Zcash, which I think was acting really poorly. Yeah, Zcash. This is really negative. You can get rid of this. That didn't happen. We had the wedge down. We had a breakout. Look promising. Came all the way back, made new lows. And now we have a full body candle coming down to new lows. This is not looking good for Zcash. Nothing here but a short. And this actually is a short right here because it's making new lows as the entire sector is kind of moving higher as well. So this is definitely a short opportunity for those who want to take it or can take it. This is definitely a short possibility. It's new lows and moving pretty firmly stronger, pretty firmly lower by the looks of it. ZRX is also one that's making new lows recently. Nothing here, guys. Sorry. Maybe from a long-term perspective, if you're looking to get some long exposure, I do have long exposure to this. Not a huge amount, but it's part of my long-term portfolio. So this is maybe a value play if there is such a thing in the crypto space. But at 6,000 Satoshi, that's a pretty decent price compared to the 22,000 or 23,000 area that it was at earlier. And there is still community development and there's still actual use case for that as well. So that's a reason why I might like that. Tron. I was asked by somebody in the comments to do Tron. This looks pretty good. So this is probably the first time I'm looking at it, to be honest with you. So I'm going on the fly. But this one does have a lot of the structures that we had seen earlier. Okay. So we've kind of got a couple of shoulders, inverse. Here's the, well, actually, even more promising is that the December low that we saw everything else form, this one formed it earlier in November. So that's even probably a little more bullish as well. And then more recently, cycle low right here. So a couple of, couple of sort of shoulders, couple of, you know, one head here. Here's kind of your neckline, some resistance, broke a couple of times, came back in, starting to get some tight Bollinger bands. I think you can possibly, if you're aggressive, take a long now and use this cluster here as a stop. But I would more, I'd more like to sort of wait for a break above this area again, and then see if we can make another big move up to 4,000 or 40,000, I should say. And then from there, there's really room for it to go much higher as well. So pretty wide base here has formed coming up against this resistance. And I think if it can break above that, then you'll definitely see a significant move higher. MKR. Well, that's, that's big. That's, that's a lot of move there. This is kind of, I wouldn't call it parabolic, but certainly a big move higher, hard for me to get into moves like this. Unfortunately, if I was in earlier, maybe at kind of like this breakout point right here. So maybe above that, that would have been a chance to get in. Now at this extended level, there's just too much risk here from 15,000 down to kind of 13, eight, well, not 13,000, but 0.15, 0.16 to 0.134. That's just too much, too much gap. And the reason why there's too much gap is because of the nature of this move dictates that you can easily make significant moves lower before heading higher again as well. Just the nature of this move. So I can't get in on that. If it gets back down to these levels, and there's probably an opportunity as well. But if you are long, this is one of those cases, if you're long, and you've gone in for, you know, for various reasons, stay long, don't get out, don't panic. Now take some profit for sure. You don't want to have this all reverse and move your stops up, right? Your stops have to be all the way up and take some profit, but let it ride as well. Because this is the type of thing, if it's gone from 0.1 to 0.17, then, hey, there's no reason why it couldn't go up to 0.2 as well, right? So, you know, these type of moves always seem to surprise on the upside, but there's no reason why this couldn't sort of keep going higher, something like that before, you know, making its top as well. That's the nature of these type of parabolic structures and moves. So just stick with it if you are long, whoever that was that asked. ARK, well, these are big wicks here. Don't like big wicks. Must not have a huge amount of volume. Again, similar thing. We have a good December or November low. So we have that head and shoulders type of inverse head and shoulders structure as well. We have the breakout. Maybe a retest of the 10-day moving average. Get back in long. If you are long, whoever asked the question, stay long as well. Again, same analysis. Pull up your stops. Don't give back a lot of your gains. Move to a profit stop and take some profit on the big spikes up. I mean, hopefully, if you were long, they should took profit on these spikes. If you could, I'm not sure what the duration was in some of these, but hopefully it took some profit on these big spikes. But stay with the trend for now. It pulls back. See this pull back here? That's what I was saying before. Getting in on a move that's way above the bolognese band is very difficult. It's just chasing at that point. And I don't like chasing because you get these big swings back and I can't hold. There's no reason why I want to hold and risk so much capital and a big move back. So there's really nothing stopping something like this, making another big move back all the way to here before going higher again. And I don't want to be, if I'm already in, that's a different story, but I want to get in at these higher levels for that reason. So two different analysis there. One is, what do you do if you're not in? You don't chase. And if you are in, then you hold and you ride that wave by taking some profit and raising your stops. And then ICX. This one here is Icon. Not really familiar with it, to be perfectly honest with you. It does have new lows in February, so not showing a whole lot of strength. And not showing a whole lot of action too. Now very tight Bollinger Bands. A move could be coming, but they've been tight all along. So this one here is not the type of thing I want to, I can't even draw a trend line that makes sense. I'm not going to bother because if they don't make sense, the trend line, then don't draw them. But yeah, this is just really flat. I mean, I think eventually this may have found a bottom, but what's the point in trying to risk, why risk or why try and force a narrative on this when it doesn't really exist at this point. I think that's my entire list. Let me just quickly go through it one more time, see if I missed anything. I covered Ethereum. Oh, ABC, Bitcoin Cash. Yes, let's go back onto this because this one here is still up on the alert. Looks to be consolidating. I think this one may end up being okay. It kind of broke out of that, right? And now it is. So that's to the US dollar. Let me find it against BTC because that's what the position was. Nope. Sorry. Bear with me one second. All right. Here it is here. Okay. So still above the breakout point, forming, definitely forming a flag. So this is bullish. It still looks good to me. I have to go and check where my stop was on this and reassess. But even a slight pullback to, you know, this sort of breakout point would not be uncommon. But I think this looks good overall. I think Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin is going to do well. Again, you want to define your risk, of course, but this still looks positive to me. And then one quick last look at the list. Yeah, that's pretty much it. I just want to thank you guys again. A reminder that you always can post questions in the bottom here. This ended up being a longer video than I thought, but I'll be away for four days. So maybe that's maybe not a bad thing. Hope you enjoyed it. Hopefully the sound quality was good and have a great weekend as well. See you soon. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.", "source": "episode-2019-02-21"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-29?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas, Monday morning on April 29th in New York. I hope you're all doing really well. Hope you had a good weekend. Let's get stuck into the weekly Bitcoin cycles report where we focus mostly on Bitcoin and the daily and weekly cycles. Take a look and see if we can find exactly what could be going on here with the cycle and give us obviously an edge from a trading standpoint. Now what I do see is we are at the potential midpoint and beyond just now. We do have a peak right at the day 30 mark, right above the Bollinger Bands for the second time. This here now carries a significant possibility that we have a top in place for the 60 day cycle. If that were to be the case, then we're looking at now the declining phase of the 60 day cycle. It would make perfect sense kind of being in this crypto winter or early bull market phase where there's accumulation where a 30 day top would be expected. Had a good move off $3,800 lows on the cycle up to almost $5,600. That's a $2,000 or $1,800 move and around, you know, around about, what is that, 20 or 30 percent, actually more than that. So that's significant enough. We probably shouldn't expect a whole lot more than that. And I also did think coming into this rally that the max would be around about, so the $5,800, maybe even $6,000 level, which that is the support area found in 2018 over consecutive 60 day cycle lows. So the fact that we're up at around 56 is probably enough at this point. Now, if it goes again and moves higher, I wouldn't be surprised, but at the same time, I would think we would be capped and, you know, and resistance would come into play and reject the rally at around 58 to sort of 5,900. So there is a very, well, there should be in theory, little upside left in this cycle at the moment. And now it's more about just looking at the cycle and seeing if it wants a hold in this sort of area right here, the area above these two cycle highs back in December and February, that hopefully becomes the floor now and the support and the resistance up here at 5,800. So do we chop around this area? I think we do for now. What I do see and what is common in cycles, daily cycles, is that we form sort of a mini head and shoulders pattern. So it's possible we kind of break down a little bit here, test these couple of low candles in this area from the earlier part of the cycle, but come back up and get balls excited a little bit more and maybe sort of form a right shoulder with a left shoulder here, the right shoulder here, the head here, and then start to sort of form that topping pattern. Come back and test this area one more time, come back up and then fall a little faster and harder and then fall down into the next cycle low. That is just a fairly common type of ending play out for a cycle. We often see this head and shoulders kind of pattern form often enough in the topping motion and then you see here you kind of have a nice arc going down from cycle to cycle. What I'm drawing here is the likelihood or the hope at least that we will have a higher high with this cycle and then this cycle and this cycle and that would make it one, two, three consecutive higher cycle lows in play and then one, two, at least two consecutive, well not so much consecutive, but two higher highs and this one being a sort of double top high. Overall though of course talking about an uptrend or the beginnings of a larger play uptrend in motion, so nothing, you know, this is just a matter of being patient at this point, letting time go by. We've talked about on the weekly level going out towards the summer months. I think we're still in this sort of big accumulation phase and an area here where people want to get excited. The market gives you something to get excited about but then does not follow through. Pretty typical of a market that you know is kind of still an accumulation and hasn't really busted out in a new bull market of course. Now I'm going to flip to a four hour chart to show you how I think we're looking a little more bearish right now. So here I'm going to try and zoom out a little bit more. Okay, so possible day 30 high, looking at the four hour now. So we had this move here, made a higher high but then came back down and this here is what concerns me the most. This type of action here is telling me that the top is probably in and if that wasn't the case, what I wanted to see here is a quick recovery and back up to rally and make a new high and that would have continued the uptrend that started all the way back here in late March. Didn't see that and now we're looking at kind of a flag pattern here more than anything else. It's not clean but it is a little bit of a flag pattern that's formed and for me it looks like, sorry I'm just trying to grab it, there you go, looks like we're starting to break down. That's why I think we may break down out of this sort of four hour flag pattern and come back down. Nothing too significant, $200 drop, test this April 11th low somewhere in that area and then bounce back up. Give the bull some hope in the second half of this cycle but of course like I said earlier, only come back maybe three quarters of the way up, form a right shoulder and then begin the more dominant decline of the 60-day cycle where here we're getting more of a decent sell-off and of course in the latter part probably from day, let's say day 50 and on then that's when we start to get a real acceleration into the cycle low. The key of course becomes how far down do we get in the next cycle low and that's always difficult to tell. It's more about price than it is sorry it's more about time than it is price and we do know that in a cycle decline price can exceed more than you expect after enough because the selling pressure is just more significant at that point. But I do think there's going to be a lot of support in this area, one because this was kind of where we were thinking it was going to break down the last cycle and it rallied higher so this was a very bullish move then of course we have the two cycle tops as well. So this area here around 4200 I'm thinking is going to provide quite a bit of support and if you look at it we're at 5200 that's a 20% decline that's a healthy and significant decline even by bitcoin standards. So that to me is probably going to be enough as of a decline. So this is what I'm looking for at the moment this is by far my primary thesis for what's coming up here in bitcoin let's zoom back out to the daily. Okay there it is there it doesn't look it looks pretty normal if you look at it from a wider lens at this point coming back down to that support area but then coming back up to fill this zone again and I think we're going to fill this zone over multiple 60 day cycles coming into late summer and beyond. And then the question just taking the time frame out even a little further is do we have a retest of the December or February lows some point in the cards in the future? I don't think it happens with this 60 day cycle but we could have a top here for we could have a top that may that may stay in place for three or four months so let's just try and draw something in here and you know I know I talk about this each week and it's important I do but we could be looking at the next 60 day cycle doing something like this okay so topping a little earlier than normal maybe day 20 day 25 not making a new high and then coming back down and coming down sharply and then into an August low this would be the big shakeout and I think that would be around the summer months good separation from the December lows this would scare a lot of people and it'd be nine months removed from the December low people would then pretty much claim that you know bitcoin's really dead at this point it's just done nothing for almost two years it wouldn't be almost two years but it'd be a good year and a half and and and then some from the big 2017 top this is kind of how we want shakeouts to to appear and then from here we can really get busy going higher and then of course you know the rest from there from the four year cycle video and so forth so this is what I'm looking at here two more cycles of possible pain or heartbreak and letdown of course as always like anything we want to be positioned long term for the possible surprise of an upside break and continuation that's why you want your full huddle position in place without question you don't want to be trying to time from a from an investment standpoint you don't want to be trying to be time a thousand or two thousand dollar drops you want to be in at this point but from a trading standpoint I think we're looking at the next possibility for a short to come on the second balance I don't want to be shorting yet it's only day 34 day 35 and we're in an uptrend so in an uptrend we don't want to be shorting unless we're late in the cycle and we have very clear evidence that we're declining but also from a long trade standpoint it's too late now it's too late in the cycle with a possible top in place to be looking for long trade so this again is one of those patient times for traders at least in my opinion and the way I trade in my style this is a time where I'm patient and I'm just letting other people chop around this market letting other people pay all the margin fees for sitting in leverage positions for example I just want to be kind of in this on the sidelines waiting for my opportunity to come in for my next trade all right let's just finish off on the bitcoin cycle on the weekly chart again healthy looking chart come up somewhat of a test of the support zone uh four week kind of flagging here this actually on the weekly is a little bit of a bull flag in fact this looks like a continuation possibly higher but I think we're not ready for that just yet to be perfectly honest with you I would welcome an upside surprise I'm bullish overall of course but I still think we have some downside work to complete before we're looking at more of that breakout higher so this here represents more that right shoulder right now showing a higher high let's probably move that back lower something like that then we're looking at a may low come back to test again this area here so let's put that in around 4200 possibly maybe the week of may 20th okay and then like I said earlier come back up doesn't make a new high move this in another attempt it doesn't make it and then I said I'm going to be looking at a higher high level of", "source": "episode-2019-04-29"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-17?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas. It is Wednesday morning here in New York on April the 17th. I hope you're doing really well. This is your midweek update on Bitcoin, and we'll go over some of the other coins and developments. Not a whole lot of change since Monday in the report. We've actually, though, moved back above the 10-day moving average. Overall, this action to me is very constructive and very positive. I don't think we're talking about anything sort of major in terms of upside, but I do see most of the strength coming beneath the market and suggesting to me that we're still in the early portion of the cycle and that price wants to move higher. So I do feel there's a lot of accumulation still going on in here and that we're comfortably holding the initial breakout point from a couple of weeks ago. And that to me tells me that Bitcoin wants to remain in this sort of 4,200 to 5,800 zone and start to fill in a lot of this gap here over the next coming few cycles before making the next move higher into the $6,000 range. So this is really positive, I think, for us who are holding more from an intermediate time frame or a longer time frame, don't ignore the strength here. You don't want to be looking for a pullback to be adding to positions. You want to have and be fully invested for what you plan to hold for at least kind of the remainder of this year or even next year, right? So if you're still light from the longer term allocation, I urge you to not discount the possibility that we do see a really big surprise. And by that, I mean something that actually does go up into this sort of $7,000 range. Not my expectation at the moment, not my primary thought, but you know, Bitcoin is such a unique asset. This whole sector is so unique that it's not unlikely, I guess. And maybe more likely than, for example, coming back down and testing the $3,000 range. I would probably, if I had to be a betting man, I would say this is more of a possibility than coming back down. So keep that in mind. If you're, you know, one of those investors, longer term focus people here, just be aware of that. If you're trading this, then we're going to have opportunities on the upside and the downside. Right now, I think the, the, the, I think Bitcoin is more likely to move up into this $5,800 zone than it is to come down. I see this recent two week action as just consolidation of this big, really big candle here. And the acknowledgement that Bitcoin broke out of this consolidation triangle period since the four, four year cycle low. So we're consolidating. And for that reason, I do believe we are more likely now in the coming weeks to see Bitcoin sort of start to maybe consolidate a little bit more, but then actually come up and do a test of that 58, 5,900, maybe even go up to sort of 6,200 area, and then form a cycle high and then come back down. Okay. Um, the longer it moves sideways in this 4,200 to 5,800 zone, the more likely it is that we're going to hold this area. And then in the coming cycle low, not breach below kind of the top here at 4,200 or even kind of this line here that I've drawn intersecting these prior two cycle highs, it would be more likely that Bitcoin would come and bounce back off that level. And that at this level now provides support for the market. Okay. So that it all depends on being able to form more of a right translated cycle here over the next few, maybe three to four weeks, meaning that it needs to spend more time going higher in general. And with the eventual peak coming at least in the, by the midpoint of the, of the cycle, the one problem we have with cycle clarity is the last cycle low. We don't have a clear marking like we have, we've had for the last three years. And this happens every now and then I tried to explain that on previous videos that we have a short consolidated cycle low here, not by a price, but by a time. And none of the indicators really show it's significant cycle low with each, um, the smoothed out, uh, D trended, uh, pattern only came halfway down, but this is the closest thing we have to kind of a detended low, which is right in the middle here. Uh, I'm taking an actual price low right here, and that could be day 47 cycle low. And then the last bar before the breakout day 54, any one of these, and it's not really any one day that forms a cycle low in this case, it's more just this cluster in this area where it should have turned lower and it didn't, and it didn't because the selling pressure eventually became exhausted and it was too, and it was met by an equally and more impressive buying, uh, support in this market here. So instead of rolling over, like everybody thought it would after this initial December decline, it actually broke higher and reversed. So that's why we have the kind of this, uh, it's not abnormality, but it's, it's more of a unique cycle low point being is that if we measure the cycle low, let's just say for argument's sake around March 28th, if we go 30 days out, we're looking at around about April 28th. Okay. So April 28th is only right here at this point. So let's put that up here. So April 28th is the midpoint of the next 60 day cycle. So from this midpoint to the next midpoint, the cycle low then should be around about May 28th. Okay. So April 28th, 30 days, April 28th, sorry, let me repeat March 28th cycle low, April 28th mid cycle, May 28th and next cycle low. So if that's the midpoint, if we can form a cycle high past that midpoint and that becomes right translated, becoming right translated means in general that we are in an uptrend. Okay. And that we are now filling in this higher price, which means I said, I suspect that the next cycle low again, as I said before, holds the prior cycle highs and that's how you maintain and continue to see an uptrend in a market where we have a continuous cycle highs that are going cycle lows that are moving higher and the cycle highs are also higher in price. And that's that up, up sort of stepping process that you see. Now, again, I think there's still going to be one big surprise guys. And I think it may become probably, so looking at May and then you're looking at June and July. So some point July and August in this area here, I think we get a surprise and that could look something like, and this is going to be a relatively um, sort of crude drawing here. So don't look at it, you know, price by price, but we think, I think we kind of get something like that fails to go up. And then here's where it really scares everybody breaks below this cycle low comes down and does, I wouldn't call it a retest of December lows, but shakes everybody out $2,000 drop. This to me becomes kind of the final scare of the bear market or final, uh, you know, final washout, uh, on, on, on fast price and high volatility before then moving up. And then, you know, eventually obviously moving up to, to make new highs and then put the entire bear market behind us. Now, does this analysis contradict what I said to start the video where you should have a full position on the surface? It does. But when you consider, like I said before, that this is only a scenario and that in the end, my main and firm belief is that by the latter part of the year, or even maybe by December of this year, we're going to see price up in the seven, eight, $9,000 range, or certainly well above this resistance at 58 to $6,000. Then that's how I'm looking at it for the longer term holders. I'm looking at, well, if the price and, and if, and if price is very likely to be up there, then don't risk your position now to get a lower price when in fact, uh, we may not get any of this. Okay. It's not a guarantee. It's just how I've seen bear markets form in the past. I like to see, um, I like to see them come back and do a sort of a big double test. And I don't think February was a double test at all. This is just an uptrend here. So I want to see that it's not a guarantee. Okay. So don't, don't get in the situation where this happens. Okay. And you're still waiting for this down here or down here in August. And that just keeps going. That's why I'm just warning you now traders. Of course, we're going to take, and we're going to trade probably short this on the way down and long this, and then short this. That's what we do as traders. We change our opinion quickly and often, and we try and take advantage of all the wiggles and all the short term trends that we see in the market as they present themselves. Right now, I really don't see a short term trend for you to trade. Um, we could, or you could look at going long here and taking advantage of this being still, still ahead of us, perhaps because we are in the early sort of stage of the cycle. Um, maybe, maybe your lows here, uh, this bottom can, okay. That's the lowest candle in Alaska, a week or two that has a low of around 49, 12. So maybe a low of around 4,900 that's possible. That's around about a seven or 8% move lower. You can take a position there, ride this up here, risk reward. It's not huge. You're probably talking about 15, 20% higher versus, uh, 8% lower. So kind of like a two to one, um, probably, you know, could be worth it for some of you, but again, this isn't something you're going to get leveraged up on or risk a lot. You're going to manage your risk. You may take a long position. And the reason why you may want to do that also is that we may get an overshoot to the upside. If you get an overshoot to the upside, you may be able to take advantage of that if you had a pretty strong position in hand as well. Okay. So that's the analysis on Bitcoin. I'm going to cover Ethereum because I think there's still maybe a little more opportunity there on Ethereum. Uh, so let's look at that chart. So I'm now out of this position. I had my stop really tight here at the 150. I used this bottom candle here, 158 level, uh, out of that now with two days ago, it came down to 156. So I'm just watching at the moment, but I think now that if you look at this a little closer, you had the top here, and then it seems like we've had a decline. This here never served as sort of a new, a new high. So we have kind of one big decline all the way down to this, uh, 156 low. So the 156 low is back below the breakout point and now it's back above. So potentially here we could be going long again. I'm thinking about it. What's holding me back is that it has not yet pierced the 10 day moving average and, and that 10 day moving average is beginning to almost, um, move lower. Now it's sort of holding the 20 day, which is good. So I want to see this move higher. So what I'm thinking here as a strategy for me is that these two candles here, so the highs are 169 and 169. So about the 170 level, if we can get above the 170 level, then we move and make sort of a new high or we make what's called a swing low. So here's the low on this candle. If we move above the high of that candle, that becomes what's called a swing low. And we would exceed the 10 day moving average, which sets up the possibility that Ethereum will or could then begin to make strides higher and actually continue the breakout pattern that we have here with this ascending triangle. Um, I'm willing to take that trade. If we see the evidence that there's some strength, I don't want to just take it right now because at the moment it is acting a little weak or it's not acting strong enough for me to say that that pattern is in effect. So be aware I move above 170.5, let's call it that 170 50. I would get long this again. And then the 156 here low becomes, uh, it becomes my stop. I want to size the trade accordingly. I don't want to be risking more than probably like 0.75 on this one. Um, because it has come back and failed or at least stopped me out once I second time around. I want to be a little more cautious and also the reward possibility on something like this up to say like a two 30 as the chart indicates or two 40 even is significant enough where I don't want to risk too much anyway, because I will be rewarded if it's right. So that's important. You want to be weighing the reward with the risk and then saying to yourself, well, if it's such a huge payoff, well, why risk so much? And that's also the same type of idea people should have and sorry, not to digress here, but when we're looking at Bitcoin from a very long perspective out two or three years and we're thinking Bitcoin 50 80 or 200,000, like I'm thinking, then it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to be betting or risking huge or vast sums of your wealth on something like that. When if it, if, if, if it pans out, then you're going to be doing really well, even with a very small position in general, kind of same philosophy here is that on this type of one trade, if the opportunity is very big, then, uh, there's no need to necessarily over leverage over risk as well. I covered the OS midweek. Uh, I still like this chart. I think this here is consolidating here to go higher. Uh, you, you always want to be long the strongest of the asset classes. We have a very, very definitive bottom here. I mean, price is already up 300% to 300%. So I do like this. You can see a huge consolidation cluster at this level here back last year and it broke down. I think now what it's doing here is trying to get above, if you look at that, it's almost a near perfect, um, spot. And it did when it broke down. So it may actually move sideways for longer because of that, but in general, this is a nice uptrend and has a clear higher lows, higher highs. So this year is a long counter for you and something you can take as an opportunity. Litecoin is similar. Litecoin against BTC. I haven't covered too much against BTC, these assets because BTC is also moving higher. So they're showing kind of flat chart patterns, but against the dollar, we see a lot of these showing really bullish patterns. Litecoin versus BTC here has had a nice consolidation. Come all the way down, starting to look a little risky here that it may want to break down back down to at least this sort of rising trend line. But I do like where it stands right here. I think if you, if you want to get a position or wanting to get a position for the intermediate term, then this is a nice pullback and a healthy spot to get back in. From a trading standpoint, I think we want to see a reversal first and get back above the 10 day moving average, then put a stop below this level here. Right now it's looking kind of toppy. The, the, the alternative argument is that, Hey, your stop is so low anyway, that why not take a long position and see if it does hold. That's one way to look at it. But, um, I think there's a very high chance it would get stopped out, stopped out based on this. So you would have to take that trade knowing that you would get stopped down again. It's very, very minimal risk if you do something like that. And then Litecoin versus the dollar, this one, as you can see, same as EOS looking more bullish against the dollar looks like we have kind of a pennant consolidation here. Um, liking that idea. And if you look at the trend higher, then it looks like you've got, you know, a number of recent sort of lows in here consolidation. And this could be another one here and looking to go higher again. So this one looks very positive to me as well. Okay. My friends, I hope you've enjoyed the update on Friday. I'll come out with a full lightning report covering 35 or so coins looking out for that, not a whole lot of movement in the altcoin space. So let's see if there is some movement, uh, between now and then to, to report on. Otherwise, um, we'll go through the motions as we always do each week. If you have any requests, as always, please add them, any comments, put them below. I'm happy to engage in any discussion, wishing you a happy trading week and speak to you soon.", "source": "episode-2019-04-17"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-02-19?", "input": "", "output": "Hello Bitcoin Live members it's Bob Lucas it is Tuesday morning here in New York I hope you're all doing really well I have a very exciting video for you today it's it's the first time in in quite a few months in fact that we do have some very positive action on the charts here and across the board this time we are seeing strength we are seeing volume we are seeing some really nice and encouraging moves it has been a long 14 month grinding bear market I don't know if that bear market has ended I suspect from a price perspective that it may well be the low back in December it's hard to say but I think we are now well advanced in the bear market and we're now into that final kind of chopping motion or chopping range of a bear market before then building a base to start to begin to get out and I think what we're seeing right now is an early cycle rally that for the time being at least should create a decent amount of fear of missing out amongst participants and should create a decent amount of upside momentum I don't see this turning lower anytime soon of course always risk management process dictates that we are prepared for a surprise against our position and against our you know analysis but right here I still believe we are only on day 13 so let's take this this is from the other day I believe we're on day 13 of a cycle I believe we will exceed the day nine high set in the last cycle so I do believe we'll exceed the 4200 area I also believe that the market is really hungry for a rally here so I believe we're going to see a move up to that day nine high probably form some good resistance at that point fall back maybe sharply just to kind of shake out all these extra leverage longs here people fomoing in right this at this level here between now and say the 4200 area but then I think we actually rally sharply and and this is just you know me talking out loud looking at the tape looking at the chart but also looking at just just the fact that we're overdue for a good sizable rally bitcoin hasn't seen the last cycle was decent the cycle before that was almost non-existent you really have to go back into august of last year which is you know a long time ago already to see any sizable rally and even that by bitcoin standards wasn't anything special so I just feel that bitcoin even if we have bear market lows ahead of us in 2019 I just feel that it's really overdue a nice sizable rally and of course those sizable rallies really only come in the early portion of a 60-day cycle we are in the early portion of a 60-day cycle this to me is looking really positive here we had a nice surge higher consolidation now we're really starting to stretch out here and I believe we could easily see like you saw here in the early cycle uh last cycle I think we can easily see three or four big green bars all the way up into this sort of 45 4800 area you know again I don't want you going out and betting in ridiculous size and leverage purely because I'm thinking this could stretch another thousand dollars from here my point is that we have momentum now behind this cycle we are in a new cycle so I think we just want to let it play out and see how much higher this market can really go at this point so I'm long now uh bitcoin as of the break of the january 19th high position is in around about the 3790 area I'm just going to let this ride my stop right now is at the lows of these candles down here though they are pretty far below at the moment I'm looking to start to to right you know to increase that stop level but I want to give this a little more room here I want to give this a chance to even come back all the way back to the 10-day moving average which at this point would be probably below my position easily below my position entry so give it some room at this point because it is early in the cycle um but anything below these candles here right there would you know would not be uh hang on let me see if I can draw that in would not be something I I think you'd see in an early cycle rally so kind of that level there anything below that point now would indicate to me that we have a very quick top and of course a very quick top here without making a new high above the December 24th high would would be very bearish there's just no doubt about that and it's a possibility in cycles and in any market of course but uh it's a possibility that we do see a an early an early cycle high that does not exceed if that happens you want to get out pretty quickly and that level here at the moment would be a you know would be a loss in the position of course but would protect your capital to the downside because I just think anything below that point anything below that line right now just would would not seem right from any cycle rally perspective you want to build momentum in a cycle rally and you want to see higher lows and higher highs and that right now is already kind of a low um here's established low so I can leave that blue mark in there just as I had these blue marks they represent recent lows in in the space I could probably get rid of this now as well so we've now exceeded a significant point here next significant point would be this generally the eighth high around 4100 that's also very close to the 42 30 area this high so these two here probably from a block perspective let's see if we can draw a rectangle in I'm sorry for the noise background noise the building's heat is going on let's see if we can draw in a rectangle if I can what am I doing here here we go so something like this right that area here probably provides the next level of resistance for this cycle and then it'll bounce off that possibly a couple times and then move higher um profit target I really don't have a profit target at the moment I think I'm gonna let this one play out I have a feeling we we may again stretch higher so I want to I want to take advantage of it here I want to move my stuff up as soon as I can but I want to be able to make some really good capital if this market moves higher I'm not going to be in such a huge rush to take profit because we are early in the cycle and I do like the way this cycle low ended with it staying above the December 15th lows the fact that it had an entire cycle almost an entire cycle except for the first nine days but the fact that it had um what is that 54 days of decline sorry 44 days of a decline without breaking below December 14th that's bullish so I want to give this some room and I can already see as I'm recording this live this is still moving you know this is still moving well so you want to get your position in if you're not in already hopefully you're in already on this line I did I did advertise the fact that if we did have an upside scenario back when I wasn't sure whether it's too high one more low or one more high I did mention that this would my this would be my buy-in point this would be my point where I was wrong on the downside and need to go to the upside so we want to be able to flip quickly our bias and our perspective when the market dictates so this is what I'm seeing right now let it play out I'm not the type of person that's going to sit there and watch this price on the minute by minute chart I'm in now and I just let it ride the more you watch and worry about how much profit you're earning on a trade the more the opportunity you'll have that you'll close out quickly because you just can't handle the gains so just don't do that just watch it let it play out I'm going to go over a couple of other positions I have I do have my XMR position still going almost came back to this new stop point that I that I published which was the break-even point so now it's still showing a decent profit giving this a chance my profit target is still up in this this area here at the 10% area which which equals the December 24th high so I'll take 50% profit here and let the rest ride at the moment the worst case here is our break-even so that's a good position to be in at a break-even point if this can move higher then obviously I'll move the stop but that's the first target for the Monero XMR position and then Bitcoin Cash let's see if we can feel that I'm also in on this I had a alert on the on the trend line it broke the trend line I got in I like Bitcoin Cash from a price chart perspective only because I do we do know that it does pump every now and then and when it pumps it goes really hard like it did here and also before the fork between ABC and the SV clients it used to do this all the time so I'm thinking or hoping at least that this although it's not looking too great so far today it's reversed back quite a bit but I'm thinking that I'm hoping that this is going to just extend and extend extend and then I'll look for a profit target much higher up I do want to bring up my stop to break even fairly soon but I want to give this a little more room at the moment before doing that so at the moment the the stop is still below just right at these candle lows here but I do want to bring this up to the trend line entry point fairly quickly but again I want to give this a little more room because there is the possibility that you kind of get a quick pull down to to retest the breakout point and then and then it goes that's also a possibility so leaving that as an open possibility at this point and Ethereum Ethereum looks great look at this this is really a this is a bottom here and I think this is also a bear market bottom for Ethereum right now um we did see I mean like Bitcoin did the same thing of two but I'm not ready to call Bitcoin a bottom yet but I think Ethereum is showing and the altcoin space is showing a lot of relative strength and relative outperformance to Bitcoin so I think we also now have the makings here of a kind of inverse head and shoulders pattern I think we're going to rally higher at this point I don't know how much higher but we know that Ethereum is capable of really moving when it needs to and this seems to be stretching here so there's no reason why I just couldn't sort of keep going up at this point at least until the early March period when the Bitcoin cycle will most likely top I would think for this cycle so I think it could do something like that up to the 200 area and if we look at previous points in the decline then this here is a really big cluster I would think let's see if I can get a rectangle going yeah so uh kind of this area all right that that's there's a lot of a lot of activity there I would I would expect that here offers the top for the cycle here so that's still a decent move from this point it also is a new high a higher high so we will have a higher low in place and if we can exceed this 160 dollar area we would have a higher high so that's that's the definition of a trend change so that would also be great as well so looking for that with Ethereum this is against the dollar of course but I think against Bitcoin it's going to show a similar outperformance as well so here we have the December low here we have a higher low so this is not against the dollar this is against Bitcoin this is important because this here the fact that it stayed well above the Bitcoin low whereas in prior declines it was well ahead of Bitcoin so it was making further lows versus Bitcoin as Bitcoin was also making lows against the dollar it's now reversed that action here and I think we have the bear market low for Ethereum and also a bear market low for many of the altcoins because of this very chart this to me is telling me that we have a pretty significant low in place it would take a long time to grind its way back up but there is a lot of room left here before this can get anywhere near level seen in 2017. So this is great this is very encouraging to me this is very positive I'm not saying go out and really buy altcoins but we now want to start looking at some of these altcoin charts and look for opportunities because we may have the momentum behind the chart to to get in with some some confidence Litecoin is also showing the way here Litecoin versus the dollar looks to be now certainly making a bottom so this here looks very positive I think we have the next big pivot area which is around the 70 to 80 dollar area sorry 75 to 80 area there's probably no reason why this could not quickly move up to the 75 dollar area in this very cycle and that makes it almost a triple off the bottom here and again these type of assets that move uh in significant multiples to the underlying Bitcoin asset so as on the way down as it sort of you know moved at a pace of four or five times the rate of Bitcoin it's going to do the same thing on the way up just as it did in 2016 and 17 as it also did in 2014 and 15 this just this is just moving at a much much faster rate on the way up and on the way down so if if we do have a bottom here in Ethereum altcoins and Litecoin and we also if we have positive action in Bitcoin we should should not be surprised to see Litecoin really exceed and excel here over the next month so this is something you want to be getting into I do have some Litecoin coming from a long-term position right now I don't have a trading position in it but this is definitely a very positive very positive development here on the chart and then Litecoin to Bitcoin again it's also it's also made its lows this is a similar looking chart to Ethereum this is doing well starting to step up now so we've got this rounded bottom pattern and now we're starting to take out levels seen on the way down so this is something you want to be paying attention to and if you do like trading Litecoin then you've got kind of the green light as far as I'm concerned to to start looking for opportunities so uh that's that's the wrap up for the main coins let me just quickly browse through some of my charts and I'll I'll look at these on the fly um but this is Stellar which I was not bullish on this was making brand new lows although you know every every dog has his day they say as they say so this one here right now it looks like it may have formed a low and this one should do well now I think everything's going to do well it looks like from an altcoin perspective versus Bitcoin I think because we have positive momentum we have you know new volume coming into the space it's the old coins that would do better in that environment Bitcoin should go up but everything should outperform it and I think this Stellar here although Stellar wouldn't be my choice because it didn't it didn't outperform on the way down I think you're going to get a knee-jerk reaction more than you are going to get any significant um you know outperformance from Stellar though it looks like other coins like Ethereum and Monero and Litecoin would do better than something like a Stellar but again there's still room here as well the one that's not doing well is Bitcoin SV Satoshi's vision uh it's not doing anything in fact let's see if I can get a chart going here here it is although I do think this will pump eventually I think every you know everyone will have their day um but at this point I'm just I have a trend line here with an alert I think if this if this trend line breaks with some volume and some size then maybe there's going to be a move here but it's also possible that there's just no interest in cash SV at this point as well so I'm definitely staying away from this I actually sold my forked SV coins I have not sold my Bitcoin cash coins but I have sold my SV coins just don't believe in any of this project I think it's a pure fraudster type scenario with Craig Wright so I have no interest in holding any of these coins um BNB finance this has been a phenomenal run this may go again this could be consolidating but I just don't know um I don't like necessarily trading I mean I like positive charts like this this is great trend but it's also it's also been extended since December or November in fact late November so maybe this is kind of like time for something else to have a run and this could pull back a good pullback I probably would be interested again but at this point I'm just uh not really that interested in something like Binance mana coin so mana uh decentral and I do have some of this um this looks like it's now broken out somewhat well I wouldn't call it with size but actually this isn't too bad of a chart uh so we had a sort of sort of a breakout here looks like it came on a good volume a good bar there I should say it's come back maybe to retest so if this can make some some moves higher at this point get back over the 1000 satoshi level then maybe this could be a buy with a stop above the low point of the recent candle that's also a possibility OMG broke out and has not done anything since not sure if this is anything I would get excited about I did have an alert on the breakout of the channel I didn't buy it but um it's it's possible that this goes higher but at this point you really want to see more uh enthusiasm from from charts like this that break out this doesn't seem like it had any Qtum here is building a nice rectangle base looks like kind of a head and shoulders bottom here starting to get some momentum has a long way to go before I get excited at this point you could in theory again these aren't clean patterns you could in theory look to go long right now and then use kind of the stop right here at 500 satoshi that's only a 10 decline so you can get a you know a little bit of a position going risk around you know 0.5 of 1 of capital on there's something like this only because you have momentum across the board in the altcoin space and ethereum it is early in the cycle this that could bail you out at that point so there's a there's a chance here that this could maybe just do something like this over the next cycle you know and that in itself can provide you know a good three to three to one or four to one risk reward entry at 550 exit at 500 profit target around about 700 so um you know not nothing not an amazing opportunity but something here that looks like it could play out purely based on on what ethereum is doing what the altcoin space is doing and the chart pattern as well and then raven coin nothing going on here it's retraced the entire move since listing on binance um nothing to get awfully excited about unless it starts to make some make some some some moves and show some momentum some volume and comes back to break this kind of trend line all the way back to 278 satoshi from over well over a thousand that's a typical kind of pattern that we're seeing over and over again with these new coins at list i think it needs a little more time before i get too excited on something like this xmr i think i already showed xrp here is uh kind of struggling and and i think if the altcoin space is doing well this one might lag it's been there's been some some negative i wouldn't call negative press but the jpm jp morgan coin might be placing a little bit of um might be placing a little bit of pressure on this coin here because many kind of consider ripple the banker's coin and jp morgan comes out with their own coin so this could be a topping pattern it did hold off from breaking this this sort of neckline that had developed based on these two on this head and shoulders pattern it held that it's come up but it's reversed that now i think if this breaks below cleanly breaks one percent below this neckline it's a short at that point at least give it a go you know so this is something to watch out for at the moment i'm not bullish on this that's definitely something i can say looking at this chart and then i'm going to end with zcash zcash did break out of this wedge looked really promising i actually did draw last week when it was up at this point i did draw in a retest of the breakout point and it did exactly that actually even went much further than that and made new lows so the fact that it made new lows kind of negates um the pattern of a breakout of a wedge and going off to new highs or not new highs but a new rally at least however it still is looking like it may rally from this point again i just like other charts better than this one i think there's a possibility that most of these charts actually go higher but the question is which one is the better looking chart overall and and this one based on the level of a sell-off here the fact that made new lows here on february 18th which is already a new cycle for bitcoin tells me that i don't want to be in something like zcash it doesn't have the relative performance that i would look for to bail me out in in a room in a move higher okay i did say i'll end in zcash but i'll actually end with 0x protocol or zrx token and this is similar here although i have this from a long-term hold it's not performing well at all it's not it's not showing us anything to get excited about we have new recent lows here as well i want to be if i'm trading at the moment i want to be in the coins that made lows back in december and made a higher low here in february with bitcoin and not ones that are showing more uh showing lows here more recently that's just just not the type of coin i want to be in at this point so that's the wrap up for today encouraging news i think we're looking good overall we just want to see what bitcoin can do at this point look for shakeouts look for look for some sharp moves um back you know look it is it is up 400 in five days right so a 200 pullback at any time is possible um don't leverage in with a size or position that you'll get shaken out of with a 200 move you want to be um you want to be positioned long but not greedy long where you just can't control your position again as always if you have any questions please post them in the bottom here i'm happy to answer them and again i hope you're doing really well have a great week and i'll have a video out in the next couple days all the best", "source": "episode-2019-02-19"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-05?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas. it is Friday morning here in New York. this is your weekly lightning report, where I cover around about 30 odd different coins, most at the request of members. take a quick look at each of the charts. the disclaimer here is that I am trading very few of these and many of these I'm looking at for the first time or I have not looked at at all since last Friday's report. so you are getting essentially a very quick view, high level view, of the chart as I see it, with very little sort of time for analysis and study. so that's that's the disclaimer. take it for what it's worth. it's just an idea that maybe will help in your own strategy or your own setup or your own identification. that being said, we always start off with a quick update on Bitcoin being the main driver of this industry or the sector, and right now, again from a cycle timing standpoint, we're going to have to wait probably a week or two before we get some firm idea on where the cycle low will be. to me, it looks like we have this time-based consolidation here that resulted in this massive surge. looks like it wants to hold these gains at the moment. I think they would have been reversed by now. I would say looks like they want to continue to go higher. we are only still actually right now, technically, I believe we are above the Bollinger Band still, so we're still consolidating or profit taking this big move higher. it looks like it's holding pretty well, could be forming a flag here as well, and that could mean that we will once this, once this move is consolidated- and let's just take a quick look at this- this is a very crude way of determining this, but if you look at the poles here, you know wherever you put that essentially, if we get this sideways chop, let's say, if it's just like, kind of like a pennant form of some type, we could still see a pretty sizable move in more of a continuation come out of that. so, looking up towards that kind of that 58 to 6 000 level that provided a lot of support that turned, that failed into this kind of bear market lows, that would probably be the peak of this cycle when it comes- I don't know when that's going to come, but that would be the upper range. it looks like it wants to continue higher, but again, we are now kind of in this no man's land area that I talked about yesterday and during the week, and in this area here I think there's a lot more- let's just call it free air. that is going to allow Bitcoin to kind of oscillate a little more wildly and it's going to be difficult to kind of trade this area. being right here and knowing that this is probably going to be some firm resistance, there really isn't much upside here to be had and there's an equal amount of almost downside. you can almost argue that the two tops here will become support, but that's not guaranteed at all. but even if you argued- and you were right- that this was a support line now and this was now a resistance line, we're right in the middle of that. so there isn't much from a risk reward standpoint that I like in terms of getting long leveraged wise. I'm talking about at this point now from, obviously, from an investment standpoint or even from a trading standpoint. having your account in BTC is not a bad thing. you don't want to be left behind if- and it's a big if- if we get some kind of really weird strength right or ridiculous move. we just don't know, with an asset like this, you don't know if you get this right, it's a possibility. so we always want to have at least a base exposure, one-to-one exposure, to Bitcoin. we want to be, in my opinion, denominated in Bitcoin in our trading accounts. even we don't have sort of an active position, you're sitting in Bitcoin just in case you get these types of moves. ideally, I think what we're gonna see, or what I'd like to see, is more of a- and let me look at this- more of a- kind of just a gradual get up there, come back down and then form kind of a cycle low like this kind of filling in this whole area. here there's no man's land without necessarily crashing down in price. that, ideally, would be the most bullish case. this would be an early cycle low, this would be another cycle low and then that puts us firmly into a nice new trend of higher highs and higher lows at that point and putting behind us almost definitively the December lows as being the bear market lows again. this is what I see for Bitcoin. again, not much of a risk reward opportunity for for the active or leveraged traders of you out there. but again, be aware of potential upside surprises. but at the same time, you know, don't be concerned if it comes crashing back into this, into this area down here. it takes a long time to come out of the basement of a bear market, out of a crypto winter, so don't be surprised with anything coming back lower as well at this point. okay, so let's get into the lightning report. I'm sorry if I missed a coin that you requested. there was just too many out there. this report is obviously edited as well, so this takes me well over a sort of an hour and a half by the time I review each of the charts and then, you know, provide commentary and so forth. so please accept my apology in advance. it's just getting too long of a list, um, but I'll do my best to get to yours as well. so here we go. ADA cardano, very big profit winner. uh, for me and hopefully for you, two thirds out, staying one third in. I love the uptrend could see a good sizable pullback at this point. have my stop set right here. it's actually 14.50 um, but have that stop just there, because I think if it gets down to that level, we could be looking at, you know, more of a more of a move back down um and this being a really sort of being the end of this kind of move. but at the same time I want to give it some room, some good size room here, to be able to continue. higher goal is at least 2400 at this point. at 24 I might come out of the position. but uh, even that's not a huge amount of upside from here I may even be looking, uh, just holding this a little more long term. see what the see what the market can give us. but something at around the 3000 level would definitely probably get me out. that would be around about 250 profit from the entry. I think that would be enough for me at that point as well. arc has broken down. from last week I think I drew this. I said this could be a long trade. a lot of these did get hit in the short term because bitcoin did rally hard. so anything against bitcoin is going to see a lot of these charts, I believe, as I go through these. but I put in this line here for a stop and it went right through it. so this is now out, could recover. but the setup is now gone and I don't like anything about this chart from here going forward. air swap also has a similar pattern: come down on the on the on the bitcoin surge come below a line I said that we do not want to cross. this does not look. not look bullish anymore, although we do have kind of a round of bottoms to in play. this could just be a reaction and now it could set up higher again. but again, nothing clear and clean that I like about this for going forward. that is a new one added for this week. overall, I like this. this is a good, yeah, this is a very, um, okay, this is the first time I'm looking at this for the and I like the fact that we've got- uh, we've got- an actual parity here with bitcoin. even though we've got some wild swings, we do see uh, it's, it's held its value against bitcoin, whereas most coins went down sharply for the longest time. so this is very positive. we see kind of a clear cycle pattern here evolving, but we do have a breakout as well. so this is a good looking chart, I think from a lot. I don't know anything about the, the project, so take that for what it's worth, but from a chart structure standpoint, I like this a lot and I think this looks like it may be setting up for a new kind of uptrend or a new series of higher prices out of this block now that we potentially also have an altcoin bear market low behind us. I do like this one. I like it not so much from a an immediate trade opportunity, but I like it from a long-term chart perspective. bitcoin, cash, abc- well, it was only a matter of time before this rocketed higher. I knew it would just couldn't work out when it would. that's the that's obviously the challenge in trading, but this looks pretty good at the moment. now we do see the past. a lot of times we get these two, three day moves and it fails or fizzles more than anything else. I don't know if that's. this is kind of the extent of the move. it's hard to really say um, but the uptrend is in place. it's just hard to buy an uptrend at this point. if you, if you are in this or if you kind of traded that, I would just stay in this and and like we did with binance and few of the other coins, uh, in enj when they went up like this, just keep riding them, but give yourself some safe distance. probably the bottom of this bar here would be kind of your get out point. I would say maybe slightly below that how it's always tricky trading kind of a massive move like this because you want to give it room to continue higher, but at the same time, you don't want to give up too much of your profits doing that. so it's always a fine battle or balance between the two. I should say, um, in this case, you want to give it some room because I do think it's consolidating and it could go higher again. and you know this. this doesn't give it justice because this is post fork with bitcoin sv. but when you look at history before that, which is bitcoin cash, we do see- uh, we did see sort of kind of really big moves over like many weeks sometimes. so it's possible that this is going to do something like that here as well, where it just, um, you know it just kind of goes up for maybe like two or three weeks, gets to who knows where at point point one, point one, five. you just don't know where exactly. so if you're on this trend, stay with it is the point. bitcoin sv: um, of course, I don't like anything about this project but- and it doesn't really have much of a price history to go on really tight, kind of just down trending, not doing much. this one has the potential- you would think right, and all these do, but this one has the potential as well to give us a good pump at some point. problem is, how do you position yourself for that? I don't see how you can and therefore it's not something I'm interested in. but, um, you know, I wouldn't be surprised one day if we see, just, you know this kind of just do that as well. okay, um, because this is fairly, fairly cheap, I guess. um, anything below kind of 0.05 or five percent of bitcoin. it has a potential to get up there, at least in the short term. um, based on the characters involved with this project finance coin, I think the uptrend is still in play- obviously got hit with bitcoin going up so sharply, still at a reasonable point, I think, this last week. this is where last week's kind of stop point, still above that point, although we kind of seem to be rolling, uh, rounding over. uh, I wouldn't say rolling over, but sort of definitely forming around the top top, but overall, you know the. so the trajectory or that sort of parabolic trend line has kind of been broken at this point. um, nothing nasty though and explainable because of that bitcoin surge. I think this can still recover and continue higher at this point. I think if you were trading it, give it some more, give it more patience and more room, uh, but keep kind of this line here, I think, as your stopping point, because anything kind of below that would really change or alter the dynamics of this chart and I think if you got below that line it would look more more like a topping pattern is in play. um right if it broke down below that. um right if it broke down below that. so I think, sort of maintaining and staying above that low there is important for the structure of this chart to continue. higher. bit shares looks pretty good. December lows rounded bottom. uh got hit, obviously, like everything else did, but still still moving higher, higher. I like this if you're long, this or could be a long-term position. I think this chart looks really nice and I would stick with it for sure. civic coin was doing really well and then got slammed by that bitcoin move down 15- 20 percent. if you had the stop below that point, you got stopped out. unfortunately, that's just the way trading goes. sometimes we, uh we have stops. for that reason, this could conceivably start to recover again and continue that trend higher and I wouldn't be surprised if it did that. but again, now that, now that the chart is busted for the short term, it's hard to get back in. if you're a long-term believer in the project, if it's more of an investment, then I can see this is a good spot to get back in, but if you're trading, I don't see the opportunity to do anything at this point. however, dash is a good looking chart. we had the good move lower with bitcoin the other day, but this seems to now be stepping up so we can start to consider sort of a new trend going up. at that point, kind of what litecoin did starting back in december, dash could be beginning to sort of form that new level. we could be looking at sort of another step right here. I think, if you like- I know a lot of people like dash from a long-term standpoint- I would be long. if you do like it, for sure, even from a trading standpoint, you can try and find a spot where it comes back towards this 10-day moving average here, like you see here, and then pick your spot and then get in and then ride the next wave higher. I do like it. I think this has, you know, a december low as well, where we see a lot of the altcoins finding, finding a low and then stepping up since then. so you've even got another step right here. so we're looking at sort of four steps. you've got higher highs as well. so this is a nice looking chart and something you, if you're an intermediate type type trader or an investor, you can still get in long here. give yourself a smaller position, maybe even a wider stop, even use this one here as your stop, for example, which is considerably lower, but then obviously you'd have a smaller position and then let yourself kind of- let it kind of come up and into this sort of um 34 000- 38 000 range, uh to to compensate for that. so wider stop, longer profit target: that's one way to potentially trade this or invest in this as well. ENJ engine coin is one of my long-term holdings. I think it's coming back to earth now. talked about that before. I'm still holding half of my initial position, took half profit somewhere up here, coming where it was exactly now, but this looks like it's coming back down, probably going to retrace the majority of this move. often, often, coins would do that or assets would do that. so I wouldn't be surprised if it gets down to this level. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets down to the original breakout point. so there's no trade to be had here in my opinion. um, this is something you want to be avoiding at this time until this downtrend settles and forms a new bottom EOS. I, like I am. I have a long-term position in EOS. uh, this looks like it's a well, not looks like it is a new uptrend. we've kind of broken a inverse head and shoulders. we have a December low stepping higher. this is definitely a coin I think you want to have exposure to. I'm not saying or even believe it's going to sort of beat out Ethereum for the next sort of in the next phase, but it's going to be a contender and it certainly has a lot of interests and it has a lot of room on the chart to move higher as well. so EOS is something I like and I think people should have a long-term position in for sure. I like the chart of ETC Ethereum Classic. I think the project is a waste of time, but, um, we hit a trade and this could pull back a little bit, but to me this looks like we could be at least heading back to this sort of cluster here, where it really broke down in October November. we do have a breakout, a similar chart pattern to to many, many of the other cryptos. uh, Monero, for example, has something similar, but this has moved up and I think it can continue higher. but cool could also easily pull back to the sort of 10 and 20 day moving average as it goes higher. so pick, pick your spots on this one. it looks like the trend is now up, so that's that's the first good sign. the theorem to Bitcoin is surprisingly not doing much. um, obviously, against the dollar it's done okay, but this against Bitcoin is underperforming. um, not sure what to make of that, whether this is more about Ethereum and development issues that they're having scaling and so forth, or if this is a sort of precursor to kind of an altcoin. uh, shake out, this could be coming up as well. both kind of have valid ideas. um, right now I want to sort of think it's. I'm still pulling back, but the- the February lows probably will provide enough support to keep it from going lower, something we want to pay attention to for sure. when you look at it versus the dollar, though, it has underperformed. if you think about now. it is kind of exceeding, uh, the February and January highs that we have, so it's kind of trying to make a higher high. uh, we can remove this from last week. it's outperformed the dollar, but everything has outperformed the dollar as Bitcoin has rallied. uh, you would have thought Ethereum, um, Ethereum would have done something kind of like this, um, already, like Litecoin has and others, so a little concerned about what, what this is telling us or what this could be telling us or what it's doing right now, but at the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if it does break out sharply and then makes another good move. uh, from here could also look at this from, uh, kind of like an ascending triangle, although not very clean. but, uh, we do have a lower low here, um, and not really not so much here as a touch point, but we have a couple touch points at the top here, similar structure to many of the other charts. so if we do get a breakout, we could probably get like a 60- 80 move as well. Ethereum can and does surprise us often like that, and if it has formed the bottom, like I think they all have, then we could eventually, uh, this could eventually be kind of a lager and make up room very rapidly and get to this zone here and let's just take a look at what that might be. so kind of in the uh 180 to 230 range is is possible. I think that would be the resistance in the next move. but getting up into that box, if it can get moving, is a possibility for sure. nothing I like about go. not enough history here. don't see a trade set up. um, overall it's flat. so nothing, nothing unfortunate here that I could add any value to you with. Grin had a little move higher, but now it's moving back down. overall the chart looks very grim. so Grin is grim at the moment. um not seeing anything to change my mind. definitely caution on um hollow here. um looks like it could be breaking down. I would definitely avoid this one. uh, only 26 satoshi, so this must be one of these. um all coins. uh, penny stock. all coin types. this looks like it's breaking down. so nothing to report here. ICX holding up icon. um looks like a around the bottom February low could go either way. I think I want to see another move higher. the bollinger bands are getting tight so this could move higher at this point. uh, different levels that we have. I think we want to see at least a move above here before looking at this again. but I will add an alert on this one: getting above that might be an opportunity because of how tight the bands are here as well and has some good consolidation and looks like around the bottom as well, so this could move higher if it gets above that point. self key looks horrible. doing nothing breaking down. I would avoid this. one. length looks pretty good. um, although it could be- could be breaking down at this point. you kind of want to be careful at that level there. but if you zoom kind of out, this has a nice uptrend in play. um, oh, look at this. this is actually outperformed. in 2000- 2018- you had this move, but since- since- since November- um, it really has put in a nice new uptrend here. this is a seller looking chart, so this is a definitely a long-term buy. in my opinion. this chart looks like it could be a leader in any, any new move in the l coin space, so I like this one as well, and this one could be a buy in this area here and then give it some kind of give it some room as well. so I definitely like chain link. LISC is also another one I like, um, not so much from a project standpoint but from a chart standpoint. although it doesn't have a December low, has a February low, it looks like it is forming a new uptrend. a couple of points here. you want to watch for. you want to. if you want to go long, you're going to want to find your spots, kind of just pop below a spot I drew last week here. here's another low here, but this looks like it could be a new sold uptrend, something, uh, for long-term holders to be aware of. that. this is, this is now a nice uptrend. you want to give it enough space, enough room to rally higher and move higher. at that point, from a trading standpoint, don't see much in the short term as an opportunity, um, but definitely stick with this for people that, like the project, Litecoin continues to impress, continue to make the moves higher. uh called this correctly. unfortunately, the surge in Bitcoin for a brief moment there just knocked, uh, knocked the position out and then rallied higher. such as life and such as trading, we move on. uh would have been a really nice 15, 20 move already from this point, but not to be. but I still, overall, love this chart. I think Litecoin can continue moving higher. I think we will, though, at some point, get another consolidation. it seems like this- um, this percentage move is similar to this one and this one and this one. therefore, I I would suggest that we're going to get a move back lower, consolidate the gains and then we can go higher again. certainly, Litecoin, from a longer term perspective, is one that you want to have exposure to, even though it is up to kind of 90 already off a 20 move. Litecoin is the type of coin that you don't necessarily want to look at the the prior price move and say, oh, it's gone already, because it does does it does ridiculous moves. now again, it'll probably pull back at some point, maybe even back to the 70 dollar range, which would be a definite buy, but considering it's gone as high as 400 in the past- I think it was- it still has plenty of room to go as well. so don't discount or undervalue Litecoin. it certainly has a very high beta to Bitcoin. a meta coin has come back down to earth. I like this one from a long term. I have a long term position in this, but had this huge run and come back down, no trade to be had here. it doesn't look like it. looks like it's stuck in this trading range and probably will be for a while. so avoid. from a trading standpoint, MKR had some good looking charts, but now it looks like it's breaking down. so this is an avoid for me. if you're a long term holder or want to be a long term holder, you may be able to pick up a good price if you're patient somewhere down here. I would think in an uptrend, this level here will act as support. so there's it's pretty close to that, but there's some room still lower at this point. maybe another 10%, if not more, if you're. so again, if you're a long term believer or holder, getting in even some position now, but getting in down this area, I think, would be probably a good long term buy for you as well. from a trading standpoint, I don't see anything I like. hey, OMG is really working out kind of how I thought. I think I drew this chart trend line in many weeks ago and look at that. it's just up consolidation, up consolidation. a little further back than you would think, but that's probably expected considering bitcoin's move. let's bounce right back up. so this one I like. I think this one has good long term potential. if you like this project. this is a nice looking chart, new uptrend. pick your right spots and get in definitely. I would recommend this one for sure. ONT looks interesting. it did break up. it's held that area quite quite well. I think this is consolidating. it might, might, chop a little more sideways at this point. get the bollinger bands. why do I always pick the wrong tool? okay, chop sideways, bollinger bands tight and then come up again. so I think this one looks pretty good. I'm going to actually take this and move it up to around about there. give me a warning if it does break out, and then that could be a stop. this would be your target for the next move. so keeping an eye on this. I like this structure. if you're long, this from an investment standpoint: stay long. good looking chart. looks like a definitive bottom here, so overall looks pretty positive to me. Qtum had a run here the other day, took me out of my position, so I'm out of this one from a trading standpoint, not as in love with it as I was. it didn't hasn't really broken out yet, but I think if it does break out from here, we we want to take another look at this one as well and see what it can give us. so I'm going to take the initial kind of alert bar and give me kind of a heads up if we can get back kind of back above this level here. okay. so that would be kind of on my watch list at this point. but this uh, significant volume, uh slam down, uh, manipulation- I'm not sure what exactly um happens in in these altcoins. we just have to live with it. so, um, I think, just keeping an eye on this at the moment, I think overall it still looks decent. uh, it looks like it has a head and shoulders bottom in place. so I do like the potential for this to break out. if it does break out, it has a lot of really what I do like about this. if it breaks out, it has a lot of upside room because you've got this big move lower that could over time be retraced uh all the way back up, you know sort of in a stepping up fashion, all the way up to sort of you know 2000 area. so it's a good uh double or triple from this point if it can start to get into a new uptrend. RLC was a request from somebody. this, uh, overall, looks pretty good. looks like it has, uh, quite a few long, long wicks suggesting this color of volatility in this, although very little volume, but overall this does have kind of an august bottom as well, double bottom retest December. so this looks pretty good. I don't know anything about the project. I don't even know what the name is. all I know is R symbol, RLC. so I'm giving you a pure chart view only, but I do like the fact that we have this big round of bottom and now looks like we have a nice, uh sort of uptrend developing and forming here. so, um, if you like the project and you're invested, this looks like a nice trend for you to ride the Raven coin. um, so this one looks like now it actually may have topped. finally, what a beautiful run that was. I would want to say that these two peaks here I'm gonna- I'm gonna estimate, uh, the top- sorry, the- the support now for Raven coin. I think this has found a new sort of bottom and drawing this out here, I would be a buyer. if you're a long-term investor, I would be loading up a little more in this area. I think this is going to provide some support if it- and I think it will get down to this zone, uh, maybe even breach it a little bit, but I think these two kind of points here are going to be important, and you know, as we, as we move forward in the next bull market, I think it comes down here and then it starts to make another move higher. so this is important. I don't see anything from a trading standpoint in the short term, though, but long term, guys, watch this area and then buy it in that zone, if you like it. moving on to stratus here, still trending sideways, looks like it has a very, very wide bottom base here, but um, not showing a whole lot besides what it did here back in December to convince me that the bottom is definitely in on this one. I mean, I want to say it is because most of the old coin space seems to have bottoms in place, but it still needs to break out. we'll probably take some action if we can get a move above this uh alert that I have set, um, but until that happens, I don't see anything that we're going to do at this point. so I'm just going to set this alert right there and just see what happens. theta here has really broken down. I was looking at sort of a, a retest, maybe like a like a handle. here still looks like a cup and a handle, although I mean cup and handles typically are continuation patterns. you need a lot of history for those. I don't know how far back this coin um, in terms of trading history goes, but does look like a big bottom. could be just sort of like a like a handle pull back before going up. but I don't trust this pattern. I don't like this chart overall. don't hate it but don't love it. certainly not a trading opportunity from what I can see. Tron is a chart that I do like. uh, still looks like a very, very sort of big uh inverse head and shoulders. a couple of different uh sort of lows here. that one's really not a low, so kind of like forms forming: one low here, one shoulder, one here, uh, December or November lows. uh, this looks pretty good. I think if it can break out of this line- I haven't allowed cert, that would be a buy. then there's room, a lot of room higher for maybe getting up to kind of this 0.06, 0.07 area up here, uh, with little resistance, uh, or at least little resistance to, let's say, the 0.04 area, which is more almost a double uh or 50 move actually kind of all over the place here. almost a 50 move from kind of a breakout point around 0.03 could get to 0.04 fairly quickly and then from there potentially all the way up to 0.06 and 7 at that point. so this could be a long-term hold at one point if we can get above this area. I think, if you like this from a long-term perspective, you want to kind of want to be buying it here and and expecting at least that this is going to start to move and break up and then move higher over a long period does look like a nice bottoming pattern overall. so I do like this chart. the vibe is not doing a whole lot here. looked like it was gonna kind of start to move higher but it hasn't really done that, still trending fairly sideways. what I do like about this: we have a September low, so it made it low a long time ago. but I think to get excited about something like this you really want to see, uh, at least a break of kind of that line there. uh, that at least puts it into. you know, a new uh continue, I guess. uh, yeah, this puts it into maybe a new uptrend or, you know, a break of this consolidation that's. that's pretty much six or seven months wide at the moment and then could get us up into this other range here and then from there there's plenty of sky and room higher. so, at this point it's just a hold. don't really see a trading opportunity. I'm not even sure if I want to be long at this point. if I like it long term, I'd want to see some evidence that's starting to move higher and it has some momentum behind it. VTC was looking good, looked like it was moving higher. now, granted, it did get slammed, like a lot of them did, with bitcoin moving fast. but, uh, I want to see this kind of what I want to see. I I would not be trading this long. I don't know if I want to be long. um, from a longer term standpoint as well, kind of want to see it get back above this line here to re-establish this uptrend. plenty of room high on this one. I know this one got slammed, uh, considerably. so plenty of room higher to go, but I think it was. I think you want to see this at least recapture the 10-day moving average. you want to see the 10-day and 20-day moving average pointing back up and moving higher and price to be above that before wanting to get long this again as well. so right now, definitely an avoid as far as I'm concerned. had a request for wax. this one is not doing a whole lot, kind of in the, in the basement as well, similar to some of them that haven't really moved yet. don't like getting into positions just just for the argument of saying that these will eventually move as well, want to see confirmation of a move, and this is sort of right at the bottom here. if it can move higher and let's just say get above recent highs, then what's it? it's a potential to look at as well. so I'll add an alert on that just to see if we can get back above. uh, oh, I might have alerts. okay, so 10, I think I have around 30.. uh, no, thanks. so let's just keep an eye on this one. I think if it want to get, let's just say 1700, get above 1700. you want to? um, you want to be going long perhaps, and then that could mean that we'll get above this point here and then we have a nice sort of bowl forming and then we can get back up and make some considerable ground on this one. for now, it's just a watch. keep it on the watch list. XLM's not doing a whole lot. had some, had a little move here, but hasn't done much sense. I don't like this overall. this chart is not looking good. everything's moving really well and it's funny because this had a very, very good bear market move where it really kept in touch with bitcoin the entire way, but since then has really underperformed. I don't like anything underperforming, especially when the entire market is moving higher. this one is moving lower, so I want to avoid this and I have no interest in this at all. at the moment. XMR was promising. this is a long term and a short term trade position that I have going on right near the stop again. but come back up, um, seeing if we can recover here, looking for this recovery and maybe continue higher. I do like this. I like it. I don't like the short term chart. I don't like the fact it came back so sharply, but I want to give it a chance to see if it can come back up and move higher. at this point, maybe a little bias on this one, because I do like it long term. so it's hard to say, but I think it has potential here. I think it can move higher again. XRP- Ripple continues this really long downtrend. since altcoins kind of bottomed in December, this has just moved lower and lower. this will definitely have its day, you know it will, but I think at the moment we still have some more unresolved price action to the downside to go looks like that. that downside action is accelerating here, mostly because bitcoin has outperformed as opposed to ripple- underperformed, I would think. but this looks like it could move lower. getting down to this level would probably interest me if we can see some type of sign of a reversal in turn. I'd be looking at going long, something like this, but for the time being it's a watch. I think. eventually see this move here, eventually you'll get something like that. so just a matter of where it sort of settles and ends before moving higher again. Tezos coming back to to earth here, but still only back to the 10-day moving average. so overall still could be in this uptrend. I would say: stick with the uptrend if you're long. I will use this little cluster here, as this is the last real low that we see. this is your get out point. anything below that is definitely a declining, a decline. but this point we still could be looking higher. want to reverse at this point though you had this bitcoin surge, pull this down, stabilize. kind of a green red, a green hammer here could be going higher. I think if this gets reversed, even if this low of today gets taken out, probably an end to this move higher. but right now as it stands, the structure still still okay and still is moving higher. but keep an eye on that. overall, XVG not loving this looks similar to kind of some ones that haven't made a move yet, although we do have a real tightening on the bands here could move, could make a nice move higher, but I don't want to be positioned waiting for such moves. but if you know, if you're trading this, this is something to watch out for. I think any kind of sharp move from here could really move rapidly up, but at the same time, tight Bollinger bands can can be a move lower right, and it's not like we have an established uptrend yet on this one as well, even though we have a December low, we don't have a sort of a nice upside break to kind of confirm the lows. so this is still a watch and be aware the Zcash not doing a whole lot seemed to made it made a bit of a move recently. but again I don't like the fact that we have March lows relative under performance overall to bitcoin, even under performance to XMR, which is kind of its peer companion in the privacy coin space. so for me, I want to just be avoiding this at the moment, not saying it can't move higher. probably will if the whole space moves higher, but it's not showing me strength. so I don't want to be. don't be trying to trade the, the laggards here. I want to be. I want to be trading the other ones that are more stronger than the rest of them. uh, Zend has broken down. this is one that I recommended a while ago. I know a lot of people jumped on this. you would have been out on my last week's recommendation to to raise the stop at this point, but now it looks like it hasn't recovered from that. bitcoin surge could be a top, short-term top here could be coming all the way back down. at the moment it is oversold, so it could bounce, but I don't like the fact that it hasn't pulled back and come back towards recent highs quickly enough and that it's lagging at that point. that's a sign of trouble. so be aware of that. if you're still long this, I would be really, really cautious and I'd be I'd be cautious about giving back a lot of the profits that you should be in at this point. uh, take your profits and run and move on. and then ZRX: this one is a long-term hold again for me, but short-term trading wise. it got rejected here and it has not recovered. I thought that would get a move at least back to kind of this declining trend line and then more of a base. so this one has not really shown us any sign, which is a little concerning. I would have thought that this one would have moved out by now. if you know, if the alts have bottomed and they're showing a lot of promise, this one should have shown promise. I'm a little concerned about that, even from my long-term holding. um, I think it will catch a bit eventually, but I'm just again, I'm a little worried that it hasn't moved. so, from a trading standpoint, nothing to have here. and then from a long-term perspective, yeah, there's some, probably some- good value here. but I'm again a little concerned why it hasn't made that move. I would probably wait for an eventual- if it does break out of this trend line for getting long on a long-term basis as well. okay, my friends, closing up here, a couple of points. one, bitcoin, sorry, uh, market cap, total crypto market cap excluding btc. so this is basically everything but bitcoin looking like a bottom. december lows are in. um, this is a very bullish and positive chart for us all, but just be aware that a lot of them have already made some moves. we could see a a nice little pullback in the short term, um and that, and we're seeing some signs of weakness in some of the charts. overall, it's moving higher, but just be aware you could get a pullback at any time to the breakout point and then move higher, meaning that, um, if you look at this kind of move here, I guess that's 80 billion back down to 60 billion, 20 move if all most of these alts could move down- 20 a shakeout and then move higher. so be aware of that. I think, in general, um, everyone's made some good gains in a lot of different alt coins, uh, excluding maybe some stopouts this last week when bitcoin surged, but in general, it's been a good couple of months. I know my sort of binance account has done really well, um, but just be aware that it doesn't mean it continues forever. you've got to find your opportunities. do not um. if you have some long term, you have your long-term positions. do not try and trade wiggles like this. you stay long and stay invested. but, from a trading standpoint, just be aware that some of these sellers may begin to fail and that you want to have your stops nice and tight and playing towards the setup that you have identified in terms of risk as well, so you don't want to be sort of caught thinking, well, the market will correct me, I'll just stay in a position. you may get caught in something like this and and forced to liquidate near the bottom here as well, again, does not apply to your long-term position. and then again, just covering bitcoin, it kind of in no man's land, not much of a- uh, an opportunity risk reward wise for me. from a trading standpoint, I remain fully loaded from a long-term perspective and like the fact that we we probably have December lows in place. this is- this is your weekly lightning report. I hope you enjoyed it. a lot to cover here. it's been a long, long morning covering this, this report. hopefully you'll have a great weekend. please provide any questions you have. I'll obviously answer them throughout the weekend and then I'll be back on Monday with a full cycles update covering the daily and weekly Bitcoin market. thanks very much. all the best, wishing you a great week you.", "source": "episode-2019-04-05"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-03-08?", "input": "", "output": "Well, good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Friday morning in New York. I hope you're all doing really well. Have a very exciting lightning report to give you today. I think it's going to be a long video. Just be warned. Although I will mark down all the coins I'm reviewing in the comment section below with a timestamp for you to be able to kind of breeze through it and go to the coins that you're most interested in. I will, of course, as always start with a Bitcoin wrap up and look at the cycle for Bitcoin, where we're heading perhaps. Then I'll get into each of the coins. Just a bit of a caveat or a bit of a disclaimer. You know my bread and butter trading is cycles. My bread and butter is kind of Bitcoin and the major altcoins because that's where the cycle really, you know, obviously the cycle was with Bitcoin. So that's what I'm trading primarily in terms of size, in my positions and my leverage. The altcoins are me just looking at a chart. Some of these today that I'm going to look at, I'm looking at them for the first time. Be aware of that. I'm going to give, in some cases, a five second nothing here or I'm going to give some analysis on the fly, okay, for the very first time. So just take that with a grain of salt in some respects because, you know, I'm just giving you my passing view on this. I may not, you know, may not be trading that. I'm just going to give you just a quick view of what I think. Okay, so that said, let's get into it. Start with Bitcoin. All right, so Bitcoin here actually is not looking so bad. Day 18 high. I think we have, well, comfortably have a cycle, a mid or half cycle low that occurred three days ago. And it seems like here that we're looking to sort of rally from this point, maybe go up. Now here's the big question mark. And I mentioned this in the last couple of videos. The question is, where does the top for this cycle form? If it formed right here on day 18, then that's not necessarily a good sign, right? It's left translated. It occurs left of the midpoint, does not exceed the prior cycle, does not create this higher high scenario that we're looking for. And then what that would mean is we'll probably get something more like this occur. And if that occurs, there's plenty of time left in the cycle. Another 30 days, in fact, because we're on day 30 of 60 day cycle. There's plenty of time, a whole month at this point for Bitcoin to really get in trouble, right? And the prior lows, the prior cycle lows, the last two, are not that far below. I mean, the February low is only $500 below and $600 to $700 for the actual bear market low. You know, Bitcoin can take, look at this candle here and this candle here and these candles, right? Bitcoin can drop four to $500 in a 24 hour period. So there would be concern if we do not exceed the day 18 high because we get this scenario and then there's plenty of time to do all sorts of sort of crazy things with Bitcoin. And that would be my concern, right? There's room below and time for this to cause damage and for this December low to finally give way. Now, if we, that's the bearish case. If we can though rally from this point and it's looking kind of positive the way, the way this chart's forming are now, if we can kind of rally at this point and get up and exceed the day 18 high, then we have a right translated cycle. We have a higher high. So this, this day 18, sorry, arrow goes away, right? It's an irrelevant number at that point from a cycle standpoint or mostly irrelevant, irrelevant, irrelevant, relative. Jeez. Um, the day nine high from the last cycle was exceeded. And then we have that high. So we have the higher low and a higher high and the makings of a new uptrend, right? So then we can probably do something like this, right? Big shake out into the April cycle low. But at that point, what, what do we have? Let's zoom out. So if we have this red bullish scenario, we're a right translated cycle. Let's just draw in red day 30 today. So let's just draw this in here. Okay. Let's have midpoint right there. Uh, this becomes the cycle high at that point. This becomes like a, you know, like a day 47 or something like that. Just throwing a number out there that becomes a right translated cycle. So the midpoint, the last low to this low, the, the high comes well past the midpoint. Uh, we get rid of this and then we have a situation where we have one higher low, two higher high, three, again, using the word, perhaps a higher low. That's the trend change that puts this December low into focus for being the bear market low, the four year cycle. So then what this allows for going forward is this trend change, this new uptrend and start to build and extend this base that we have. So we can rally from this point, uh, start to rally up, and then we can even go up to match the $6,000 area, which was the base of that descending triangle from all of 2018. That would provide a lot of resistance, but we can then make a move over the spring months, test that area, come back down and then, you know, sort of form that next cycle low in June, but at a much higher place and, you know, probably somewhere definitely above this first cycle high that we had. Let's just draw that out like that. So that 4,200 area, the two sort of peaks here would become support, but maybe even above this line as well. So that's also a possibility where we do something like this. Okay. Let's just draw that across and then this cycle low form something like that. Okay. So you're starting to see now this step up, step up, step up process where Bitcoin is forming higher highs and higher lows. And then, you know, that could probably bounce up for maybe even six months at this point up against a $6,000 level, which was that huge, um, you know, huge support before it, it was given, you know, before it gave way back in 2018, that's going to provide some resistance, but still point is that we get out of the kind of the gutter that we're in right here, the base and come up and step up to the next big level. But again, a lot of this also depends on what happens in the next five or 10 days. If we don't exceed this day nine candle, we don't have that new series of higher highs. And that puts, you know, puts this base, this bear market base in jeopardy, this sideways chopping motion. And actually I've been talking about, we do need to, at some point prove that we can step up and make a new higher high. So I'm looking at that really close at the moment. Uh, I'm encouraged, uh, you know, I'm long right now with a very tight stop, um, looking for a move at least back to just, just for the half cycle, at least back to sort of 41 50. But I think we can also break out a little bit and get up, maybe even up to sort of 45, 46 possibility. Okay. Um, let the market play out at this point. Okay. So now we're going to go into the lightning round. They are going to be, they're going to be alphabetically because my list is sorted right now. Alphabetically. I'm just going to go through, start picking them out, give you some quick views on each of these. So we're going to start with ADA Cardano. Uh, so this one here, I have, I have an alert sitting on this trend line. Uh, I do like the inverse head and shoulders pattern. The neckline is here. That's ultimately where you'd want to be sort of long, long with size, but I do notice here that the recent drop, uh, managed to stay below the bottom shoulder here. That's a good sign. We're starting to develop more of a complex, uh, or more, more of a deeper shoulder here. Um, I think here, if this can hold this area and start to move higher again, break this red line, it could, it could mean going long with a stop at the lows right here. Uh, and then going long again with a more size kind of on this, uh, on this neckline right here. Okay. Um, so that's what I like about Cardano. I think this looks pretty good overall. Looking at arc here, this has got, it has a really huge spike. I mean, that's just massive 2300. There mustn't be much, a lot of volume in this, but I do like the basing pattern. This also has that, uh, inverse head and shoulders. Look about it. It broke the neckline. It's already out. It, it retested the neckline perfectly. It launched higher. It's come all the way back down. You would think if this is going to continue higher, it's going to do it fairly soon. So this here, uh, this is not for me. It's not my type of trade at the moment. I don't know anything about this, but I know some people have asked about it. Uh, this has potential here, a lot of potential for going and continuing higher. You stop with definitely at a worst case be the lows here on February 16th. Okay. So if you're going to do anything with that kind of like, look at that, it's still quiet, not that far below. It's around a 1250 trading of 14, uh, 1400 to Toshi right now. So, um, that's, that's a spot you can possibly getting long around here. It's sort of clustering here. I could, can break up higher, uh, not a beautiful pattern, but, uh, it does, it has at least broken out of the inverse head and shoulders. So it has the potential to continue higher at this point. And we've seen by these wicks that there's, uh, the potential to push this much higher. Another request, air swap, AST. This chart looks pretty good. Um, nice space, uh, December low, February, February higher low. Um, nice move up here turning again today. This could be a long trade right here. Look at that. Uh, I would say play it nice and, nice and tight. Your stops are right here, uh, at around about eight, eight 79. So, you know, tired enough at least I like this pattern. I think this is a buy Bitcoin cash is looking fairly weak. Um, I did look for a breakout. Uh, didn't, it didn't happen here. It came back down, still trending sideways, unless it breaks this new trend line I've drawn. Um, no real interest here. If anything, this could break lower as far as I'm concerned. Bitcoin cash looks the same as Bitcoin. Sorry. Bitcoin SV looks the same as Bitcoin cash. Apologize about that. Um, nice, pretty flat, uh, nothing really going on here. I, I, I mean, this is going to pump at one point, but it's not looking like it's going to do that now. Binance, what a run looking parabolic for sure. Um, starting in December at the 1200. So at 12,000 level up to 40,000, that's, you know, three X move, um, structure of this definitely looks like it's, uh, you know, going parabolic. I think it might've topped here pretty big reversal candle, but you know what? It's still well above, uh, sort of a 10 day moving average still probably outside of the Bollinger bands. Let me see if I can enable that. Yeah. It's just coming back into the Bollinger bands. It hasn't collapsed yet. If you're long and treating it, you can stay long here. Um, but at some point, you know, this is going to come all the way back down, probably come back into this cluster at some point, which is a sizable decline. Um, but certainly it's going to come back. But the question is when can it go higher? And of course, anything in a parabolic type state can always go higher. So, uh, ENJ engine coin, wow. This, this thing is unreal. I have, this was actually probably like the third or fourth largest altcoin holding of mine. I just dumped around two thirds of it this morning on the market. Um, this is just, it's just too much for me to ignore, you know, coming up from a, what's that, uh, below 950 to 5,000, a five X move in 10 training days. I mean, that's great, right? It's, it's, it's good if you're holding it, but, um, for me, I mean, it's too late to trade. So if you're trading this, I would get out. This is, this is enough. Um, this is rallied way too much. I think this comes crashing back down to kind of the 2000 area, and then it can, it's maybe to rebuy if you, if you want to go long and you like it longterm from a trade, uh, this, this looks like it's, it's run its course perhaps. Um, but yeah, I mean, this just looks great. Uh, I think from a longterm perspective, I also like this one a lot. Um, but again, yeah, this is just run its course. I would be taking profit at this for sure. Somebody asked about civic coin. Um, this is, um, not looking like anything special kind of around the bottom. We had a low low in February. Don't really like too much about this. Now, of course, if the old coin space across the board takes off this, this will go up as well, but in general, nothing, nothing exciting to report here. EOS looks pretty good. In fact, um, I have a trend line here from the other day. It did a bounce. It's looks like it could be going higher again. It's, it's kind of come out of this basing pattern, this inverse head and shoulders pattern. Um, I like this. I'm going to remove that. I think if you go long or if you are long, if you are long, stay long, if you want to go long, you could, uh, the stop would be this bottom candle here. 8,000 for eight, four, two, zero is kind of your stop. Um, I like this shot. This looks pretty good to me. I think EOS has turned the corner. It has put in a pretty long, pretty wide base. And I think this could do something like that and continue higher. So, yep, I definitely like EOS at this point. Well, Ethereum looks like it has a sort of bear market low in place. I've talked about the December low sort of sticking higher low here, but it hasn't really done much since. Um, so just curious to see what this is up about. Uh, I think it, it wants to go higher, but it's, um, yeah, it's just not really responding like I would have hoped. Uh, I, I'm not taking a long trade on this, but if you were long, your stop is probably this candle right here. Obviously the prior cycle low is also a point to be out a hundred percent, but yeah, there's no real, um, nothing really exciting about this chart that wants me to, to jump on this. Some of the altcoins I've shown already seem to have much more promise than what Ethereum is showing right now. Next up is icon ICX. I'm long this. I did an alert on this. It's, uh, looking still constructive at this point. Uh, it's up around, uh, 60 Satoshi around about six or seven percent since the alert, I've moved my stop up slightly up to the March seventh lows here. Um, that is a logical zoom in here. So here I don't want it. My stop was right below the March 4th, sorry, the March ninth candle, moving it up to this candle here. I want to try and get it up to kind of that break even point as fast as possible, which is around about the eight of five. I think it is. Um, yeah. So at this point still showing a potential loss on this trade, if it does reverse, but the chart looks pretty good at this point, it looks like it could rally higher and it's a type of, it's a type of coin that could probably easily make up to around this sort of 11,000 area. So my goal for this, because I'm going to spend a little more time on this because it is a trade. Uh, my goal here would be to get to break even as quick as possible and then look for a sort of a 10% move up to around about maybe the night or actually the peak of this candle today would have been 10%, but look at around about 920, 930, take some profit, and then maybe let the rest ride up to around about the 1100 area for potential profit. So that's what I'm looking at for icon. Another member request from the comment section with self key. I know nothing about this project or this coin first time looking at this chart and I'm not impressed. We have not only do we not have sort of the February cycle low as, uh, as the low, right? We wanted December low to be below because that's, that shows us a higher low, but we have fresh lows in March and that's not good. So this for me is a sell. This is not a good looking chart. Of course it could always rally up, but from what I see here, it just shows relative weakness and I'm not interested in something like that. Now LISC is also showing a February low, not a March low, uh, but at least it seems like it's turning up. So, uh, this one has the potential to surprise. I'm not sure if anybody's really talking too much about it right now. Let's see if we can kind of, yeah, it's, I mean, it's not really, it's not really a nice clean, uh, pattern or anything like that, but it seems like it may want to be, may want to pop out here. Uh, it looks like it might be forming kind of a, um, you know, it's formed a low and it looks like it could be rallying from here. So, uh, not something I'm particularly interested in, but this here has some potential here. If you, if you kind of know this coin, you know, the way it trades, um, you know, and you're comfortable with it, then there's an opportunity here. Of course the cluster of candles recently around the 3,100, less than a 10% move is your stop point. Um, even the 10 day moving average could be a stop point as well, make it much tighter. So this one here I'll kind of like, um, not a huge fan, but this is constructive and it looks like it might be starting to make a move higher. Of course, Litecoin is the darling, uh, at the moment making massive moves higher. Um, my experience over many, many years of trading is that when something is dramatic, dramatically outperforming everything else that's pushing the upper Bollinger bands, that is extremely overboard on the RSI and stay with it. Don't go against it. All right. So you either want to be not touching it. Um, or you want to be riding it, you don't want to be shorting it, never want to short something that's strong like this. This is a beautiful looking uptrend. It's taking out prior, uh, sort of pivots and cluster points during the down decline. Uh, nothing, nothing negative to say about this. Now, of course, you're going to get some pretty sharp pullbacks a lot. Um, and, and those are probably good buying opportunities. Like for example, now it's sort of stretched out of, from this cluster here, from this sort of flag pattern has now rallied. So it could either trade sideways for a while, it could dramatically come back to kind of the, the trend line or the mean or the 10 day moving average. And that would in theory be another, um, another point of entry as well. So this looks good overall. MKR has been on a good run and I think it's looking like it wants to go on another run here. Um, let's have a look at this. Yeah, this, this, this is looking pretty good here. I think this is consolidating all these gains. Um, it doesn't look like it's going to roll over. If it did, then you're probably looking at the lows from, uh, I think it's Monday or Tuesday right there as a stopping point. This could be a long trade or you can wait for kind of a breakout of, uh, you know, kind of this line that I've drawn here, which is sort of the top of each of the daily candles, um, loosely at least. Um, but yeah, this is, this is looking pretty good. I think this based on this strength, I like that this could be a sort of a, uh, consolidation here, some profit taking before maybe going on another run of similar sort of length. So at least something that, uh, sort of covers this length here from this breakout, seeing another one of those go up to the sort of a 0.22, 0.23 area as well. Um, we've kind of got a good reset in some of the technicals. So this looks pretty good overall. Um, I'm not sure if I would take it right now, but, um, it does look pretty good. Yeah. Ontology is a request that I had in the comments, uh, looking good. Yeah. This has got a base. This has got a December low that's lower. February low. That's kind of a double bottom. Good move higher from here. Come back down to 10 day moving average coming back up. I think this is a long, I'm not taking it, but this is a definitely a long stop is, uh, the candle from the weekend. I think it is that, um, that would be an indication if it was to go below that it's probably doing a double top. So if it did this, that's an out for sure. But you know, it's coming off a double bottom here. It's had a good move, consolidated, some profit taking and that's coming back up. I think this has potential to go much higher at this point, at least to sort of this area here. Okay. And then looking back, there's plenty of room above to go further. Raven coin. Wow. This one has become popular. A lot of requests for this. Uh, I missed it this time around, even though I had an alert set on this very trend line. Can you believe that it's just the way the way trading works? Um, I had it for the first move higher, and that was a really big, uh, profit winner for me. And I also had it posted on alerts here at Bitcoin live, but not this time, um, dramatically overbought extended, but that's how some of these, uh, breakouts and pops in the alts work. Right. But I don't know what to tell you right here. It's still above the Bollinger bands. It hit almost, uh, the 1000 Satoshi level. That was kind of the top right here as well. Even though we had this really big wick all the way up to sort of 10 50, I think it was, but Hey, this is a double top at the moment. And I'm not sure what else you'd be looking for coming out of a 250, 300 base, a three X move. That's kind of enough, right? If you're trading this, you want to be watching it really closely because um, you know, if, if you want to hold and maintain this trajectory and hold your position, you've got to give it a lot of room. A lot of room means giving up maybe 200 to 300 Satoshi just to stay in position. Good chance that if you keep doing that all the way up that you're gonna, you're gonna end up sort of selling at this 900 level, 900 level. Anyway, my, my point is that if you hold now with a 300 Satoshi sort of trailing stop, it goes up to sort of 1100 and then you're still holding that 300 Satoshi trailing stop. It's going to pull all the way back eventually to 900 and take you out of position. So if I was in a position right now, I'd be scaled out pretty, pretty significantly by this three X move here. And then looking at this candle as well, I would be potentially, I would, I would pretty much be getting out at this point, to be honest with you. I'd keep some, maybe just to keep writing it, right? Cause you want to, you want to, you want to try and maximize a move like this, but after a three X move, or even a two X move, in fact, but after three X move, it's like, Hey, take, take your profits big enough. It's way more than you expected. I'm sure if you went long, the breakout, you really weren't thinking 900 Satoshi, you were probably thinking 500 would be phenomenal. So if you've, you know, if you've managed to hold this long, kudos, right? That's a clap for you. You've done great, but probably banks and profit and move on as far as I'm concerned.

{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-24?", "input": "", "output": "Hey, good afternoon Fintap members. it's Bob Lucas. around 3: 20 pm eastern standard time in New York on the 24th, about 40 minutes before the close. looking at gold here had a good recovery today with a dollar up sharply, so that's a an interesting development here at the moment. uh, yesterday we did see a good clean break of of somewhat of a flag pattern that developed over the past four days. the uh, the consolidation there was pretty much expected. considering we had five pretty steep red candles before that and then leading yesterday to this breakdown, i thought we would just continue going lower and lower and lower over the next five days. it reversed yesterday, formed a little bit of a hammer candle and today we're looking at a green candle. it's come all the way up today to the what's the high, almost um 12.79. so interesting here i i think, well, i'm still fairly comfortable or confident that we are still in this icl decline. this to me is still not enough for an icl to form. it's also fairly early in this daily cycle. so pulling back here to me is still just a counter trend move in what should be a decline down to the icl, more likely at the end of the month or early next month. um, we are now only touching the 10-day moving average. so at this point i think a full close, a daily candle close above, or even come certainly comfortably above the 10-day moving average, is a warning that we have bottomed for gold. um, now again, the structure of this, now that we are in decline, tells me that we should have another leg lower. if we measure kind of the daily cycle, high at 13, 10 down to this 12, 70 area, it's a 50 move. this is consolidation of that 50 move. another 50 move, say from the middle, gets us down to around about 12, 25, 12, 30 areas. so that's where i'm still targeting and looking for. i think, again, like i said before, any move back above 10 day, certainly any move back above 20 day moving average, is a sign that we probably have bottomed and i want to get out of my position. so overall i'm still fairly short gold- that gold position has not changed for me. uh, lowering my stops as we go down give it some room above kind of this 12, 80 areas, like a 12, 84, for example. 12, 85 is more than enough at this point. anything above that then it's no point in giving back a good part of the profit that you may have. uh. also, when you look at uh- let's take a look at dust, for example. so dust, um pretty big candle yesterday took some profit. uh, half profit on the position. um started off this morning very strongly, has come all the way back down, so that's a function of gdx. let's look at gdx here. so gdx is looking a little similar to gold. so we did see the clean break. so we now have the daily cycle decline and the break. um came down below the bollinger bands and now has reversed kind of nicely today. um, so you know people are like: oh, that's it, it's over. my experience with the miners is that you know you're going to get many more. uh, you get a few of these counter trend moves and reactions and then continuous declines. this is just not enough as far as i'm concerned and now, especially since it has broken down, i think it wants to keep going lower. at this point i'm going to flip over to a weekly. this is dust on the weekly, gdx on the weekly. so look, we did break the 10 and 20 week moving averages, which was expected. we broke that channel that i've been talking about on the uh in the week in the weekly reports. so we kind of broke this uh investor cycle channel that we had, but we have not come down on huge volume just yet and we have not come down to test or touch the lower bollinger bands like i like to see on almost every icl decline, every icl decline going back. look at all those lows. um, typically will, as, as you see there, typically we'll always hit the lower bollinger bands at some point. we're nowhere near though at the moment. so, oops, sorry about that. um, i think we still have a little more room to go. uh, seeing a one or two day balance is not expected, because gdx is down around about 10 percent from the recent highs only a few weeks back. another reason for taking some of the profit in dust: it had a nice move higher. i wanted to be able to sit a little more comfortably in a profitable position, knowing that i took half of my position as profit. so now a little more comfortable in riding the rest and potentially giving back. if, for example, the miners have found- and gold has found found the bottom and you know, dust starts coming back down like this. obviously at some point we'll get stopped. i don't mind getting stopped at a at a rising stop level if, or because we took half of the profit already at this point. so that's another reason why i took some profit on that in that position. switching to the s? p now- interesting, day 32 today. a little bit kind of like a spinning top there. i think yesterday, today was a slightly higher high, so a swing, a swing high, could occur tomorrow. this is 31 days to the current high, which is around about what you expect. we also potentially could expect a shorter cycle because we had a slightly longer cycle for daily cycle number one. so i think, now that we're just shy of all-time highs, it's very possible that we do top for the daily cycle, start to come lower and that's going to be something the bears are going to jump all over and talk about big double tops from the all-time high that we're very close to at the moment. i know the nasdaq has made an all-time high, so the russell is nowhere near, but i think people are going to call this. if it does form a daily cycle top, they're going to call this a double top with the all-time high call for, you know, the bear market to decline to, to take hold. i don't see that. i see this coming back down. i see a nice little retracement, and maybe not even as far as this- down into the second daily cycle low and then a move higher to new all-time highs. now i don't know or have too much of a strong opinion on where we go in the third daily cycle and where we go for this investor cycle and also where we go for the remainder of 2019, but i do think we're going to get all-time highs and i do think we're going to get those comfortably. then we'll see if the market wants to create a trap, a huge bull trap, just above or maybe five, three or five percent above all-time highs. it is possible. i just don't want to. um, i don't want to necessarily be strongly biased in any one way. what i do know is that we have a pretty significant rally and trend in place since december and even zooming out all the way out, we have seen periods of consolidation over a year or so that have led to higher moves. uh, the only thing about this one is that it's actually, if you think about it, goes back to all the way here. so, yeah, it's a little. it's a year and a half again as well. um, there's enough kind of feel in this area here. let's see if i can kind of just rectangle that out. there's enough in this area here, if you look at prior moves, to propel the market much higher. so we had, uh, one sort of similar move in 15, probably even longer right, maybe even as long as that, so around about almost two years, i think that one was which then led to this massive move, and then, of course, we had the big uh one here in 2011.. it's possible we have another one of these types of developments here- consolidation over a year or more, and if that's the case, then we could look at possibly another four or five hundred point move in the s? p, if not, if not more like a 600 point move, a 20 rally at some point, uh, next the end of this year and then into next year as well. just something to be aware of. just thinking a little uh outside the box, i guess a little more longer term for now, though, um, i i don't want to be shorting or discounting this. i think any short opportunity comes on the third daily cycle. that's where you may be looking for a short. i think if we get a good pullback, certainly below the 20-day moving average. i will buy uh leverage long. a reversal below the 20-day moving average. okay, similar look for crude. this um is now probably even gone beyond my expectations. but what i've been saying the entire way: you want to be long this or stay out of its way. when crude oil gets in a, it gets into this type of sort of mood, like it did going down and now, like it has, going up, it's sustained and it is pretty. it's a pretty significant and extreme type of move um. i think this could or should pull back as well. i think the daily cycle is more likely to be aligned with the s? p cycle. currently i think i have it in my reports marked right here. it's hard to say um, there's a couple of different. you know possibilities here. but if it aligns with the equity cycle, then we can look for kind of a top as well in this- excuse me, in this region, and then look for a cycle low coming up, something like this, and then form the cycle low and then go again, make another attempt at some pretty big move, maybe even get a move above 70 or easily above 70, and then see what happens from that point. all right, all right to the dollar and what the hell is going on. this is the strangest type of move. we had a one, two, three, fourth daily cycle expected to come down, sort of test this area or somewhere at least to the bottom of this rising support line. it has not done that. it has rallied really sharply. um it. it questions the count on the weekly cycle as well, but we are making deep investor cycle highs here. but also, more importantly, we've taken out the last eight daily cycle highs and we are now at multi-year highs going back to 2017, so almost two years since the last high. this can only be bullish, except for, of course, a big bull trap. but you know, expecting and thinking and hoping for bull traps is a pretty much a loser's pro. you know a loser's position to take because they don't occur most of the time. the market goes with the prevailing trend- prevailing trend since early 2018 from these lows is higher. i gotta think that we are going to be moving higher out of this as well. so, on the weekly chart, there's only one interpretation here and that we're on week 15 of the weekly cycle. don't see any other icls right here. this is a short cycle. if it was only around about 11 weeks doesn't doesn't make any sense that that would be a cycle low as far as i'm concerned. um, so price now well and truly above the 10-week moving average. made new hires, exceeded the last investor cycle high. we now have one, two and wherever this high settles, would be three consecutive low highs, higher highs and we have a minimum of one, two higher lows. obviously, the definition of a long-term cyclical uptrend: gotta respect this, as much as i don't like to see this from a from a goal perspective. uh, gotta respect what i'm seeing in this, in this chart pattern here. and if this is an ascending triangle that breaks, then you've got pretty much a significant move, maybe up to the 101- 102 area as its potential. the only thing the bulls will have to be concerned with is that, like i said before, the weekly cycle counts. so we could uh be looking at a sort of final drive impulse- not so much impulse but final drive- in this investor cycle up to this point that gets everybody thinking we have a clean breakout, come back down and form the icl and basically break the ascending chart, a triangle pattern that's developed. alternatively, what we could be looking at in a more bullish case for the dollar and let me get a different color- is that we continue to confirm the breakout, come back down, test the breakout point- which is not uncommon in a breakout of a triangle pattern- and then continue higher. that would be a valid chart chart pattern, i should say, um, as opposed to one that breaks down and forms an icl here. so that would be somewhat of a shallow icl. let's move this to there. and that one is the blue. okay, that's the board. i'm sorry, but that one becomes the blue investor cycle low. the green investor cycle- sorry. the the red investor cycle low chart would be down this area, which would negate that, and then in that case we would be looking for then a top also in the three-year cycle and then a move lower as well. i know a lot of the kind of gold bugs, dollar bears kind of or not, kind of a really gung-ho on this type of pattern, but they've been sort of going home on a breakdown for the longest time. there was a big. there was talk of a head and shoulders top right here for the longest time. that didn't work. then there was talk of a double top with this. that has now not worked. now people are talking about it and what i just what i just described here, which is a sort of a false breakout or a bull trap, then come back down and lower and i- i i don't favor that opinion only because, again, the way this consult this has consolidated bullishly. every time it tried to drop, drop in daily cycles, it continued higher and and found support, and now it's sort of breaking out and higher as well. so this is the the one sort of concerning part. now you could also argue that, back on the daily, the last two candles have been extremely bullish and powerful and gold has actually moved higher. so what's all that all about? so there's something to possibly be said here. maybe there's something more going on overall in the market with a dollar up and gold up. but you know, i find a couple of day correlations can exist where you don't expect them to, and then the true or the expected correlation- when this case being sort of a negative correlation- comes through and then you start seeing more of that. so that's what i think it will happen eventually. so that's my update for this week. hope you enjoyed it. i'll have a full weekend report out on sunday. take care and all the best.", "source": "episode-2019-04-24"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-08?", "input": "", "output": "Hey, good morning Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Blukas here in New York, Monday morning, April the 8th. I hope you had a great weekend and all doing really well. This is the weekly cycles report, mostly covering Bitcoin itself. And then we'll go into some of the coins that might be moving or maybe of interest to you. So from a cycle picture, we have, I think, some positive developments that are occurring since last week's really large surge that we had. The fear was that this might have been some really big trap, right? Just a one hour type of deal and then a reversal back down and then sort of continuation lower. That has not happened. So I'm now fairly confident in sort of saying that we have a time-based cycle low in place, a short 54-day cycle following another short 53-day cycle. Both of these lows not creating any significant price damage or significant price lows. This one was fairly mild, although it was a downtrend. This was an uptrend that exploded higher with a new cycle. So we're on or in the early part of a new daily cycle or 60-day cycle. I think overall the fact that we're still holding strong and day-over-day increasing or rallying at this point and hugging the upper Bollinger Bands is really positive. This puts, with each passing day, puts this December low further sort of cemented in as being the bottom of the bear market and the bottom of the four-year cycle. Doesn't preclude, but of course, Bitcoin retracing over the next few months back down towards those levels. And maybe even in the worst case scenario, over maybe sort of five minutes or 10 minutes of extreme selling, we actually get a new price low. But that's something for later to talk about. Right now, I actually like this action a lot. I think we are going to hold this range now above this line and above the next line here on top in between here, this kind of new area now that we're out of this triangle. I think it's going to hold this area possibly for the next 60-day cycle. So what I think is going to happen mostly now, and again, we're in an area here where it's difficult to get long because we have what I believe is going to be significant resistance up here at the $6,000 level going back to the descending triangle bottom. But also, I think we have some support, but we're still kind of in the middle of that point. I think we can still kind of just move along like that, get to the point where we get up to the $5,800 level, maybe even tease and create a really nice bull trap up sort of above $6,200 very momentarily or briefly, and then come back down and then work our way down into the next 60-day cycle. That is at least what I think is the most likely scenario. But we're also, again, just not to sort of keep harping on the same thing, but we're in that point now in the bear market, in the crypto winter, breaking out of this sort of higher high area into new, into range where anything can really happen at this point. We just have to be patient with where this market might be moving over the next 60 days and find the spots that make sense from a trading standpoint. And like I said before, right now I'm sitting on my hands from a Bitcoin trading standpoint. Even though I like to go long, there just isn't the reward here in my opinion. Now, for leverage traders, there might be if I switch to, for example, a four-hour chart, and maybe be able to find some spots where I could trade long, for example. But I don't think we want to be trading that quickly and that frequently here with this type of analysis. We want to be picking our spots. So we may want to just wait now, wait, wait till we get up to this area here and see a possible short up towards the 5,800 area. Or alternatively, if we do get some type of retracement back down, maybe back towards, say, a 10-day moving average back into the high 4,000s, that could reset sentiment and reset the technical indicators to a point where I may be looking to get long again. Overall, there is no short to be had right now until the cycle develops and passes more towards a midpoint and also closer to what we believe should be a natural resistance spot, where we at least can provide a pretty tight stop just above the area here where you would think Bitcoin would not go and that resistance would reject price. But right now, just be patient here. Just be happy with the fact that we have the overall market cap going higher. We have Bitcoin in the $5,000 range, where just a month or two ago, we were in the $3,000 range. That's a nice sort of 50% bump, 40, 50% bump. We should be happy with that. And we should be happy with the fact that we are now 16 months, almost 16 months removed from the peak of the prior bull market. So that means all this extra time here is getting us closer to the next bull market and the next wave of awareness and accumulation, for example. And that's just all positive overall, right? This is what we've been waiting for patiently. So from a trading standpoint, just be patient for now until more clarity develops on the short term and just be happy with where the overall sector is moving. Flipping over to a weekly chart here showing the 60-day cycle highs and lows. So we have, I mean, this is really good, right? So we've got now a higher high for the second time and a higher, sorry, a higher low for the second time. And then we have at least the second higher high here as well with this here being sort of a double top that now has resolved to the upside. So we definitely have a new trend on the weekly scale as well. And this is very positive. We had a similar downtrend where we had lower lows and lower highs in the bear market. So now in what I believe is this crypto winter accumulation phase, we are seeing that higher, higher structure. I do believe we're going to get one shakeout at some point, whether it's this week, next week, next month, or in two months time, I can't tell you, but we're going to get a shakeout. Very few bear markets or new formed four-year cycle and bull markets very rarely avoid not providing a nice big shakeout. But until that point, this is still really encouraging. Look at the volume on this here, at least at Bitstamp, for example, highest volume since this candle back in April. Back in April, when this rallied, and I remember it clearly, people still firmly believed that this bull market trend for 2017 was intact. So we had a lot of interest still. So the fact that we have a lot of interest or just as much interest as we had back in April from a trade volume standpoint and positive trade volume, I think it's very encouraging. If you look at all the other period since then, here we go, let's get a triangle, rectangle, I should say, look at that area right there. That area here in the bear market had very little volumes. See that here. And then since then, now we've got this accumulation, the volume is just much higher at lower prices, of course. So this is all very positive. I think we get up, we test this resistance area, like I said, in a daily chart, and then we probably get some shakeout at some point. I don't know when. I've got it marked here in August. It could well come, like I said, in the May cycle low. We could get all the way back down in sort of late May, back down to sort of whatever number that is that that scares the hell out of everybody and then come back up. All those on the table. But overall, this is all very positive in a longer term cycle standpoint. I'm seeing a structure here that I like a lot. And I do firmly believe we've put that bottom in. Just give it some time here and accumulation. And that accumulation could take seven or eight months in this area. So investors will just be patient, will pick up more if they need to, if they feel they're under allocated on each dip. At this point, they would do that. And then from a trading standpoint, we're going to find our opportunities, whether they're short or long, but now just be mindful. And I'm going to flip back to a daily chart here on the daily chart. Be mindful now that if we're going to short, we need a better setup than before. In this environment here in the bear market, I was shorting early on. I was more confident in my shorts because I knew we were in a bear market. Now, I don't believe we're in a bear market. So my shorting needs to be very calculated and at very opportune times where the risk reward is good, where the cycle count is more advanced, where there's a logical tight stop, and where there's a good opportunity to go lower. So what I'm more mindful of now is that if we're in a new kind of accumulation phase or bull market, that I could get longer more often with not so many ideal situations, or not as ideal situations, because we have a bull trend behind us. So that can forgive a lot of entry and timing issues that we may have. So I also want to not be taking profit as quickly and as early as I did here when I was going long. Before when I was going long in this early cycles, I was taking profit sharply and quickly because I knew the market could reverse at any given time and rapidly and take me out. So I wanted to bank my profit quickly. Right now, each time I get long going forward, I'm going to be holding that position for longer because I want the market and the bull trend to reward me for getting in. Okay, let's take a look at Ethereum real quick. I think Ethereum has languished and not done too much. But I think it could be ready to go. It's one of those assets that always gets a run at some point and it hasn't yet. And I think this is sort of waiting in the wings here to make its move. So just keep an eye on this. I think I'm going to have an alert set for just sort of above this area here. Against the dollar, excuse me, it's made a nice move already. And so it's definitely moving higher. I like this one here. I would also be long this one here from a dollar standpoint. This looks like it could be breaking out. And we know Ethereum, once it makes a move higher, you've got 200s, 300s, all above. And if you look at Litecoin as an example, it went from 400 down to 20. And now it's back up to sort of $90. Ethereum was at what's that? $1,600 down to $70. So I'll move back to $200 and $300 similar to Litecoin is probably not out of the question here. So I'm just keeping an eye on this one here. I like Ethereum versus the dollar. I may be looking at that from a future standpoint, but also Ethereum versus Bitcoin, I think has a chance to break out as well. All right, just posted an alert very recently, a Tron versus the dollar, not versus Bitcoin versus the dollar, because I had this chart mapped. And I heard I had my alert set. So I've taken a long here. Short would be just below this candle here. If you zoom in. Okay, right below kind of this blue area here. All right, give it some room to come back. But I like the way this is breaking out. Got a very nice base here to work with. Kind of like a head in the middle here, a couple of shoulders on either end seems to be coming up and looks pretty strong at the moment. I think something similar on Tron versus BTC could be had as well. The chart doesn't look as nice. Of course, I liked it versus the dollar. But yesterday's candle as well could be used as a stop. But I do like how clear the Tron dollar chart is. So that's what I've taken based on the chart alone. I'm also still long XMR BTC not doing a whole lot here. I'm starting to think that this is not going to move. Still have my stop below. Just paying attention on this one for the time being. And just, you know, let's give it some room. And then if it doesn't do much at some point over the next few days, probably by Friday's lining report, I'd probably cut the position and just let it go. All right. So that's the wrap up for the cycles update on the daily chart and the weekly chart. Overall, very encouraging, very positive. I think we have a lot to be excited about. I think we have a lot to look forward to in 2019. I think if we keep our head, find the right positions, the right trades, and also stay fully invested across the board, it's going to end up being a very rewarding period for all of us to stay the course and just focus on, you know, on what we're on, what's developing here in Bitcoin and across the crypto space as well, all positive and all very good developments. All the best to you. Leave some questions for me and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.", "source": "episode-2019-04-08"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-03?", "input": "", "output": "Hello Fintech members, it's Bob Lucas. It is Wednesday morning around 9.45 a.m. in New York. I hope you're doing really well. This is your midweek update. Looking at gold to begin with. So I'm looking at kind of a kind of a flag here. I wouldn't call it a bear flag but certainly is some consolidation coming off the three or four day decline. This for me won't reverse higher. It doesn't have the sort of the makings of a reversal higher. It also doesn't have the makings of a daily cycle low from what I can tell. Even though we are already up to around day 17 or 18, I think now we're going to see a breakdown of the support line here. Let's call it the neckline. I'm not necessarily saying this is a head and shoulders pattern but this is fairly typical looking daily cycle structure towards the end of an investor cycle. So now I think we're looking at that final section, final decline in the ICL somewhere kind of in this box. Price wise we don't know. I'm not expecting much of a drop, got to be honest with you. Just because it's held up for so long, we're at week 33, very extended investor cycle. I think gold is acting superbly well at the moment. Also considering the equity market's almost near all-time highs again. Gold's holding up extremely well for that reason. I think any decline we get is going to be fairly mild. But again, ICL declines can always surprise. They can go on for longer and deeper than we expect. So keep that in the back of your mind. I do think we're going to pierce the downside of this maybe today, maybe by the end of the week, I think more likely. And once we do, we'll have an absolute confirmed failure on a daily cycle level. We will take out this cycle low back in March. That will obviously confirm that we're now finally moving into the final ICL decline. And that sets the scene for a more lasting low and then perhaps a continuation of this really nice uptrend that we're starting to see over the last sort of four or five months. This is the encouraging news. So we just need to get through this decline first. I suspect that just zooming out, we will at least test this support line using the last, or sorry, the three daily cycles from earlier in the investor cycle. I'm not sure if it holds a lot of weight necessarily from a trend standpoint, but that is probably the minimum target that I would draw. So around about 1260, it's only around a $30 drop from here, which is nothing for gold. But I wouldn't be surprised if we actually get some more declines as well, just based on the fact that ICLs do tend to drop much more than we expect. And the fact that we haven't really had much of a decline yet. The peak here is around the 1340 area. We're only down $50. And for a 33 week rally, down $50 or down even down to this point, we'll be down $80 from the top, not a whole lot. So let's expect some more downside as well. I think any upside surprise here is a new investor cycle. I've talked about that before, but I think we would want to at least see a move back above the highs of this daily cycle, which is a confirmed, no question, no questions asked daily cycle top here. There's no other interpretation for this here. There's a couple of interpretations for the low, but this here is pretty much the high. So any move above that at this point is pretty much negating the downtrend that we're seeing and is a new investor cycle that we want to buy because it would be a significant surprise to the overall structure that we're seeing. On the weekly chart for gold, now we're finally starting to see a little more downside action here that's starting to fill in and complete the potential ICL. I talked last week and the week before in the weekly report, how we just didn't have any of the types of sell-off indicators or any levels of indicators to even remotely assume that we have an ICL in place. I think now this is starting to really break down the way we want to see it. The 10-week moving average almost always turns lower for some point during an ICL decline. We're now seeing that we have a second week below the 10-week moving average. If I enable the Bollinger Bands, we're probably going to see. Okay, so we've got quite a bit of room left, but at least we're popping down towards the 20 average there. I think we'll get below that and then we may even see at the worst case, like we do very often in ICL decline, see how we come down and sort of touch or even test the lower Bollinger Bands. In a very bullish market, you come close to doing that, maybe not even touching, but still there's a lot of room here and that's why I want to see some of this field before we can move higher again. Stocks continue to impress. We are around day 18, I believe it is. Could be looking for somewhat of a little peak here at this point, then come back down to a half cycle low and then perhaps rally again. We are getting really close to all-time highs again, not too far away and I didn't really expect we would even test, let alone come close to exceeding the highs in this investor cycle, the all-time highs in this investor cycle. So it's not out of the question, it would be an impressive feat to be able to come back and now take out all-time highs. I think it's going to stall before that point. I think we may come up and test it a few times, something like this half cycle low, right? DCL and then maybe come back down. That means that kind of the bears will get really excited that we have this massive double top in place even though they've been talking about sort of, you know, three-quarter retracements and then reversals. We'll be talking about head and shoulders patterns as well as a top. They will use any narrative to support being very bearish. At this point, evidence suggests that we are in a bull trend still and we've had this massive correction that could, that is fueling this move and it's just too early to say that this is over. Now, obviously, there's a lot of negative, what appears to be on a frequent basis, a lot of negative news out there, but again, news does not drive the overall market. We need to see a breakdown in price and at this point, you know, anything above this daily cycle low is bull territory. There's no reason to be bearish longer term unless we get below this level and then we can start to think about that and from a trade standpoint, yeah, there's a potential to maybe short in the latter part of this second daily cycle if it gets up towards maybe testing all-time highs, but now there's just no shorts here. Don't even try it. Waste of money. Probably should have been long here during earlier in the week. I think it's too late now. There's just not enough reward here for the level I would need to place my stop at for the risk. So just staying away from that for the time being and just paying attention more than anything else. But overall, you know, this is encouraging. It's positive six-month highs. What more can you ask for? Respect the price and stay out of the way or trade long. Very similar action in crude. I feel bad that I didn't take advantage of this. I pretty much called it out the last couple of weeks. I was looking really good during the week. I was just looking for one more pullback to go long, but instead it's now gone up pretty much around about five or six percent. It's quite a bit. I think it can continue going higher. Once crude gets into these sort of moods and rides up a bollinger bands, they can go on for longer. But now getting close to some of my targets, $63, $64 area. Hard to take a position now after it's moved up from $58, $59 late last week. But still encouraging news. The cot report still looks pretty good. It's fairly neutral at the moment. So I think pullbacks here may be an opportunity to get long. Okay. But crude overall still looks pretty good, like the equity markets do. And then lastly, the dollar, we could have another one of these tops. So it could have come a little earlier. Maybe I could just move these over a little bit. Something like this. You know, it's been a seesaw swinging action. Very consistent though, from the dollar up, down, up, down, up, down, up, probably down, probably up. And then looking for the big ICL in kind of May, I think at this point, still relatively early in the, well, not relatively early, but not late in the weekly cycle yet to, to worry about a top. Sorry. That means late in the weekly cycle to worry about it going higher at this point. I'm pretty sure that the top is in place. We had this brief cycle failure right here. I think we have top right here coming close to testing, and now we're going to start heading out and into that declining phase on the weekly chart, kind of see it here getting tighter and tighter. This is a bullish pattern. In my opinion, this is what worries me about gold in the longer term. But now we have, I think we have this top in place. And I think we start to sort of chop in here, maybe, maybe get down below the triangle very briefly, but wouldn't be surprised if this provides some good support because we do have four or five touches on this bottom line here. So maybe coming down and touching it here and then coming back up is a possibility for sure. Okay. So that's the update, midweek update for this week of the Financial Tap. I hope you're all doing really well, having a great week. The full report will come out on Sunday. All the best to you.", "source": "episode-2019-04-03"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-29?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas, Monday morning on April 29th in New York. I hope you're all doing really well. Hope you had a good weekend. Let's get stuck into the weekly Bitcoin cycles report where we focus mostly on Bitcoin and the daily and weekly cycles. Take a look and see if we can find exactly what could be going on here with the cycle and give us obviously an edge from a trading standpoint. Now what I do see is we are at the potential midpoint and beyond just now. We do have a peak right at the day 30 mark, right above the Bollinger Bands for the second time. This here now carries a significant possibility that we have a top in place for the 60 day cycle. If that were to be the case, then we're looking at now the declining phase of the 60 day cycle. It would make perfect sense kind of being in this crypto winter or early bull market phase where there's accumulation where a 30 day top would be expected. Had a good move off $3,800 lows on the cycle up to almost $5,600. That's a $2,000 or $1,800 move and around, you know, around about, what is that, 20 or 30 percent, actually more than that. So that's significant enough. We probably shouldn't expect a whole lot more than that. And I also did think coming into this rally that the max would be around about, so the $5,800, maybe even $6,000 level, which that is the support area found in 2018 over consecutive 60 day cycle lows. So the fact that we're up at around 56 is probably enough at this point. Now, if it goes again and moves higher, I wouldn't be surprised, but at the same time, I would think we would be capped and, you know, and resistance would come into play and reject the rally at around 58 to sort of 5,900. So there is a very, well, there should be in theory, little upside left in this cycle at the moment. And now it's more about just looking at the cycle and seeing if it wants a hold in this sort of area right here, the area above these two cycle highs back in December and February, that hopefully becomes the floor now and the support and the resistance up here at 5,800. So do we chop around this area? I think we do for now. What I do see and what is common in cycles, daily cycles, is that we form sort of a mini head and shoulders pattern. So it's possible we kind of break down a little bit here, test these couple of low candles in this area from the earlier part of the cycle, but come back up and get balls excited a little bit more and maybe sort of form a right shoulder with a left shoulder here, the right shoulder here, the head here, and then start to sort of form that topping pattern. Come back and test this area one more time, come back up and then fall a little faster and harder and then fall down into the next cycle low. That is just a fairly common type of ending play out for a cycle. We often see this head and shoulders kind of pattern form often enough in the topping motion and then you see here you kind of have a nice arc going down from cycle to cycle. What I'm drawing here is the likelihood or the hope at least that we will have a higher high with this cycle and then this cycle and this cycle and that would make it one, two, three consecutive higher cycle lows in play and then one, two, at least two consecutive, well not so much consecutive, but two higher highs and this one being a sort of double top high. Overall though of course talking about an uptrend or the beginnings of a larger play uptrend in motion, so nothing, you know, this is just a matter of being patient at this point, letting time go by. We've talked about on the weekly level going out towards the summer months. I think we're still in this sort of big accumulation phase and an area here where people want to get excited. The market gives you something to get excited about but then does not follow through. Pretty typical of a market that you know is kind of still an accumulation and hasn't really busted out in a new bull market of course. Now I'm going to flip to a four hour chart to show you how I think we're looking a little more bearish right now. So here I'm going to try and zoom out a little bit more. Okay, so possible day 30 high, looking at the four hour now. So we had this move here, made a higher high but then came back down and this here is what concerns me the most. This type of action here is telling me that the top is probably in and if that wasn't the case, what I wanted to see here is a quick recovery and back up to rally and make a new high and that would have continued the uptrend that started all the way back here in late March. Didn't see that and now we're looking at kind of a flag pattern here more than anything else. It's not clean but it is a little bit of a flag pattern that's formed and for me it looks like, sorry I'm just trying to grab it, there you go, looks like we're starting to break down. That's why I think we may break down out of this sort of four hour flag pattern and come back down. Nothing too significant, $200 drop, test this April 11th low somewhere in that area and then bounce back up. Give the bull some hope in the second half of this cycle but of course like I said earlier, only come back maybe three quarters of the way up, form a right shoulder and then begin the more dominant decline of the 60-day cycle where here we're getting more of a decent sell-off and of course in the latter part probably from day, let's say day 50 and on then that's when we start to get a real acceleration into the cycle low. The key of course becomes how far down do we get in the next cycle low and that's always difficult to tell. It's more about price than it is sorry it's more about time than it is price and we do know that in a cycle decline price can exceed more than you expect after enough because the selling pressure is just more significant at that point. But I do think there's going to be a lot of support in this area, one because this was kind of where we were thinking it was going to break down the last cycle and it rallied higher so this was a very bullish move then of course we have the two cycle tops as well. So this area here around 4200 I'm thinking is going to provide quite a bit of support and if you look at it we're at 5200 that's a 20% decline that's a healthy and significant decline even by bitcoin standards. So that to me is probably going to be enough as of a decline. So this is what I'm looking for at the moment this is by far my primary thesis for what's coming up here in bitcoin let's zoom back out to the daily. Okay there it is there it doesn't look it looks pretty normal if you look at it from a wider lens at this point coming back down to that support area but then coming back up to fill this zone again and I think we're going to fill this zone over multiple 60 day cycles coming into late summer and beyond. And then the question just taking the time frame out even a little further is do we have a retest of the December or February lows some point in the cards in the future? I don't think it happens with this 60 day cycle but we could have a top here for we could have a top that may that may stay in place for three or four months so let's just try and draw something in here and you know I know I talk about this each week and it's important I do but we could be looking at the next 60 day cycle doing something like this okay so topping a little earlier than normal maybe day 20 day 25 not making a new high and then coming back down and coming down sharply and then into an August low this would be the big shakeout and I think that would be around the summer months good separation from the December lows this would scare a lot of people and it'd be nine months removed from the December low people would then pretty much claim that you know bitcoin's really dead at this point it's just done nothing for almost two years it wouldn't be almost two years but it'd be a good year and a half and and and then some from the big 2017 top this is kind of how we want shakeouts to to appear and then from here we can really get busy going higher and then of course you know the rest from there from the four year cycle video and so forth so this is what I'm looking at here two more cycles of possible pain or heartbreak and letdown of course as always like anything we want to be positioned long term for the possible surprise of an upside break and continuation that's why you want your full huddle position in place without question you don't want to be trying to time from a from an investment standpoint you don't want to be trying to be time a thousand or two thousand dollar drops you want to be in at this point but from a trading standpoint I think we're looking at the next possibility for a short to come on the second balance I don't want to be shorting yet it's only day 34 day 35 and we're in an uptrend so in an uptrend we don't want to be shorting unless we're late in the cycle and we have very clear evidence that we're declining but also from a long trade standpoint it's too late now it's too late in the cycle with a possible top in place to be looking for long trade so this again is one of those patient times for traders at least in my opinion and the way I trade in my style this is a time where I'm patient and I'm just letting other people chop around this market letting other people pay all the margin fees for sitting in leverage positions for example I just want to be kind of in this on the sidelines waiting for my opportunity to come in for my next trade all right let's just finish off on the bitcoin cycle on the weekly chart again healthy looking chart come up somewhat of a test of the support zone uh four week kind of flagging here this actually on the weekly is a little bit of a bull flag in fact this looks like a continuation possibly higher but I think we're not ready for that just yet to be perfectly honest with you I would welcome an upside surprise I'm bullish overall of course but I still think we have some downside work to complete before we're looking at more of that breakout higher so this here represents more that right shoulder right now showing a higher high let's probably move that back lower something like that then we're looking at a may low come back to test again this area here so let's put that in around 4200 possibly maybe the week of may 20th okay and then like I said earlier come back up doesn't make a new high move this in another attempt it doesn't make it and then I said I'm going to be looking at a higher high level of the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market course after the summer months for now I think we still need a little more pain to inflict I think sentiment has gone a little frothy again and that's good because we are up obviously 2000 plus off the lows but I think we need a little more pain and we can go higher at that point again cycles from a four-year cycle standpoint December looks solid at this point as being the lows but nothing stops the market from going in on a really fast intraday maybe like within a sort of a 30-minute training period or one hour training period making a slightly lower low to me that wouldn't change the four-year cycle low being in December even if we get a new price low it happens sometimes on a fast market that we get a new price print that's lower the only time this does not become a four-year cycle low is when we spend a few days even a week below in new lows and that would not be that would not be part of the new cycle and we have to mark this as an extended four year cycle don't see that happening to be perfectly honest with you I don't see new price lows also but I do expect some type of test and if that comes in may even better if it's something ridiculous like this that's even better because then that gets that gets the bottom of the bear market in sooner as far as I'm concerned and the sooner that comes in the faster we can get up and go and start making headway up in towards the seven eight nine thousand dollar range okay so that's the bitcoin analysis for this week this is the monday report which is more in depth on the bitcoin cycle let's take a quick look at a couple of other coins that might be moving for the week so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so! so so so! so! so so! so", "source": "episode-2019-04-29"}

{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-02?", "input": "", "output": "Hello everyone, this is Bob Lucas. It is April the 2nd in the morning here in New York and I hope you're all doing really well. So the Bitcoin four-year cycle is in. The December lows right here mark the end of the prior four-year cycle. A cycle that went for 52 weeks lower in a bear market and 153 weeks high and the bull uptrend for a total of 205 weeks, just three weeks short of a full four years. This video is an update to the four-year cycle video I published on YouTube around January 15th. A video that was recorded originally back in late December, right when we were looking at this decline here in early to mid-December, it was about a week or two short from this final capitulation here. I think a video was posted on one of these declines here right at the beginning of December. But this December low here on December 10th, or at least the week of December 10th, now marks what I believe with and nothing's ever certain in trading and investing, but with a very very high degree of certainty or at least high degree of confidence that the four-year cycle low has ended. That four-year cycle low comes at a perfect time in the four-year timing band at 205 weeks and really does not leave any further interpretation for a low to come in the future to make or complete the four-year cycle. If you had watched that video back in January, I did talk about the possibility that the February low, the 60-day cycle that was due could exceed on the downside, the December low, and then that would stretch down to become the four-year cycle low. But that hasn't happened. Instead, what we're seeing here is a whole lot of strength into this new four-year cycle and a move now just today above the prior to 60-day cycle highs. So this move today here on April the 2nd is essentially for me confirmation that this December low does mark the four-year cycle low. We've got too much separation in terms of price, but more importantly too much separation in terms of time here for this move to be anything other than the beginning phase of a new four-year cycle. For all your investors and hodlers out there, really the four-year cycle is all for you and about you and back in January I made it very clear and in video since that you don't want to be looking and waiting for further lows. We are deep enough and were deep enough in this bear market in terms of price at an 85% decline from the high and also in terms of time as we already approached the four-year cycle time frame for the next low. This here was the opportunity to start accumulating and as I said many times to make sure that you have a fully loaded position, a position that you're comfortable with, a position that you can take higher and not risk essentially your livelihood and your family's livelihood but enough of a position that would make the difference in the long run. Now it is absolutely way early at this point. It is not too late to be invested or fully invested if you did not get and heed that warning and get your allocation correctly. It's only Bitcoin at the moment is only $1,000 essentially off well maybe $2,000 off the lows here not even $2,000 off the lows. In the grand scheme of things this is going to be kind of a rounding error to some extent and it is not too late. At the same time you don't need to panic right there's probably going to be now a period of consolidation from this move and a sideways continuation of the sideways move similar to what we saw when the last four-year cycle ended. So let's go back now four years almost exactly four years right here and pretty similar time frames in fact if you look at the end of the last four-year cycle coming off a 58-week bear market decline you see this massive drop and good volume into January as opposed to the recent low which was December and then you had a nice sort of move higher but then kind of a partial retest it really wasn't a retest on the absolute capitulation price points there but a retest at least to the closing point of the candles here and then a nice rally higher and this is kind of where we are right here I think if you can relate the same if you can overlay this is a similar type of move here where I think the market has a recognition there was also a higher high that was kind of put in here the last time and this is kind of recognition that the four-year if we were tracking the four-year cycle load back then in real time this development is similar to what we're seeing now where it kind of confirms a higher high structure in the market now similar though to today I don't think we're going to escape at least without something similar to this and this here you know scared the hell out of a lot of people back then it came down from you know it doesn't look like much here because we're dealing with a small number essentially but from a percentage standpoint from 317 all the way down to a low of 198. this decline here back in July of 2015 was almost 40 percent down to the bottom which is obviously more than significant this would have whipped many of the new bulls out of position it would have whipped many of the people buying late and it wasn't late of course in the grand scheme of things but buying here after sort of a 40 or 50 percent move these people here probably a lot of people here leverage a little too much or bought an over position thinking that it's going to continue rapidly higher and then probably gave up a lot of that puked a lot of this out right here before then rallied and never looked back now if we go back to the current period here this is probably something similar a lot of people probably buying a lot of extra bitcoin right now thinking that we are going to see something phenomenal like this occur and hey i never want to rule any possibility out in trading and investing but i feel very very strongly that this is not going to happen not going to see anything like this and people who are buying with this type of view or scenario in mind are going to leverage up a little too much they're going to buy way too much they're probably going to either borrow uh maybe even use a credit card for example but essentially buy bitcoin with funds they can't afford to lose and then what might happen instead or what's more likely to happen at least is that we get a lot of chopping we may get some more higher prices but we may even get something like this okay and this would come down into the next cycle low uh the 60-day cycle low and then that type of move would punish anybody that's over leveraged right here in the short term so the point of this is that if you're trading sorry if you're investing for the long term if you have that four-year cycle play in mind and don't overdo it right here the type of potential and reward that we have ahead of us for the people who are patient over the next three to four years is so great that you don't need to be leveraging or risking too much capital right here that's going to throw you off position if we do get a nasty shakeout and if you look at the four year cycle low here this was nasty but this to me was perfectly expected uh i certainly was short the entire way um but we haven't since then had a nasty shakeout so the last shakeout we had was five months ago bitcoin and actually almost any asset class if you look at gold as well how it trades it does like to inflict a maximum amount of pain on traders and investors and i don't see how we get above this eventually above this six thousand dollar resistance area without a major shakeout at some point i'm not saying it's coming this week or next week or next month it may not come until august okay um we have to get through a number of these 60-day cycles still but it's i'm pretty confident in saying that at some point and let's just draw out a few of these here so we have a 60-day cycle april we're looking at another one say in june okay we may not get let's shake out here until august so let's just draw in something like this bear with me one second here drawing in the highs and the lows of course all just hypotheticals here all right all looks great until we get shake out so let's try and clean this up just a little bit here all right but the point is not for neatness the point is to say that some point maybe even as late as let's just say august we get a 60-day shake out here we get this really horrific you know one and a half thousand two thousand dollar decline even and that's perfectly normal in many regards in any market whether it's a bull or bear market but even in the bull market you do get these nasty shakeouts you know one of the things that you're going to do is to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market all these people that are just getting far too excited about the possibility ahead buying way too much than they can they can handle and then what ends up what happening is that not only do they sell and capitulate on this fear and believe it's going to go down and break below the december lows but they end up losing on the extra leverage and they end up losing their strong hand position that bitcoin that that position in bitcoin that they never was going to give up or didn't want to give up because of the panic and the fear and the amount of losses they're inflicting so you end up in a situation where not only are you kind of out of bitcoin or have a very light load because of this type of sell-off but you end up losing overall on the market and then something like this in a new four-year cycle if it was to occur is more likely to be a v-shaped recovery in price so we would get a shake out but then we would get an almost immediate bounce back back to the point where it started breaking down from to begin testing that zone before maybe wanting to come back out and then begin a more sustained full market trend now that the accumulation phase is over i also want to point out that from a short-term standpoint and a trading standpoint i'm able to flip between viewpoints on a daily chart rapidly so i'm not going to give you and i will refuse to give you day-to-day views on where i think the market's going to go because again you know i can be short one day and can be long the next day so it's uh it's pointless in doing that so take a lot of these short-term lines and squiggles i'm drawing um with that perspective in mind these are guides i like to focus on time i am a time specialist more than anything else with with the study of cycles and the lines i'm drawing here are simply more for guiding purposes and nothing else so you know i don't have a crystal ball here um i like to work with the time frame more than anything else so we could also see you know a more immediate move lower back here kind of get below here and then sort of chop sideways a little more and then come back into this point i think overall what i want you to take away from from with this analysis is that i now firmly believe uh basically a 98 belief right because it's never a hundred percent once once you go absolute and stick to an absolute statement you're going to be uh you're going to be screwed essentially from a trading standpoint you'll never be able to get away from that view and that bias and you'll be trapped regardless of what price tells you but i have a kind of a 98 confidence level now that's the december cycle low is in and that we are now into a couple of daily cycles 60 day cycles into the four-year cycle we are three or four months into the four-year cycle and the four-year cycle if we look at the prior two cycles as our guide i'm going to try and zoom out a little bit here i believe will run for approximately 150 weeks the prior two cycles ran for 153 weeks in the bull trend and the one before that zooming down was 142 weeks so again just a guide just an estimate for planning purposes but looking at around 150 weeks to around the october 2021 time period it's a lot of time right and a lot of room to move so lee as an investor and a hodler put that into perspective how this market squiggles and wiggles and and you know also oscillates here over the next coming three or four months is irrelevant to you as a long-term investor if you continuously are waking up in the morning and checking price but you're a call yourself a long-term hodler uh or investor then you're doing yourself a disservice by allowing price fluctuations in the short term to influence how you invest in the long term very important concept please try and really appreciate that statement and understand your time frame and be happy to be in that time frame from an investing standpoint and ignore what happens just as you should have ignored this three two thousand dollar decline you're going to ignore to a large extent even though you're going to be happier of course but you're going to ignore the one or two thousand dollar move higher because your prize is up here your prize is a couple of years away and it is up here okay not designed to not designed to get everybody really pumped up but that's really the prize that's what you're in this for this is the four-year cycle horizon that we're looking at so um again let's see if we can kind of give give you i'll give you an outlook to what i see potentially happening here over the next few months and then maybe let's just stretch it out to the four-year cycle top first thing i believe is that this six thousand or fifty eight hundred to six thousand dollar level on bitcoin is going to act as some significant resistance it provided significant support on the way down in the bear market there was repeated and repeated attempts to break below that everybody thought that was going to hold and the market was going to go up i did not and and i don't want to get into necessarily why at this point but from a descending triangle standpoint i think the breakdown here was obvious but at the same time there's going to be a lot of resistance at this point when it comes back up to test that area i don't know when it comes to test that area that's that's the key or the problem right now i don't know exactly when we test that point but i think it'll happen sooner than later we could even get that in the next week we can get that in the next few days we don't know but let's just say for argument's sake we get up here and we test that would just be the first test i think at some point and i'm just going to draw this in again again loosely right at some point maybe around the august time frame we get down and we i don't think we get anywhere near necessarily the december lows we probably get closer to the february lows okay around about 33 3400 um again arbitrary numbers i'm throwing out it's more about time so i think we get down here and we scare the hell out of all the longs they get worried that it's been kind of seven eight months since the low it's taken too long it's now reversed lower they start to panic they're too leveraged and of course they get they bail out talked about that five minutes ago let's move on here then i think we come up and we kind of start testing this area a few times now i don't know if we can get above that period about that 6 000 point in 2019 i gotta be honest with you we've got to be patient here it takes time to build a solid foundation and a solid base in any new four-year cycle but at some point we probably do get above this six thousand dollar level and once we get above that we may drop quickly back down but then we get it back above and then that same level begins to act as support okay and then we can begin to find an area that has um you know less less weight and um less friction and we will then begin to accumulate or to begin to to rally higher with a little more intensity and velocity okay so when does the rally in the next four-year cycle really take hold and what you notice here is that most of the gains in the four-year cycle occur right near the end and it occurs quickly and rapidly and very few people take full advantage of it and it's just too difficult to do if we go back to the original four-year cycle this is the breakout point right here in january of 2013. the major top occurs in november of 2013. 11 months from exceeding the prior high and then rallying in this case from 13 or even like sort of 20 or 30 dollars here to 1 100. that's the gain of the cycle in 11 months then if you look at the prior cycle and you look at the 1100 top from the first four-year cycle and you draw across here's the breakout point the breakout point occurs in april of 2017 think about that april 2017 to december now you're talking about only six months of or seven months to the next high so from the april highs of around 1300 to 20 000 pretty much the entire gain this is where new all-time highs come in right so for approximately almost four years we don't have any new all-time highs and then we see a sort of 15x move occur in seven or eight months or 10 months i'm sorry i keep confusing myself there but you get the point point is that most of the gains the really big speculative gains occur only once price hits a new all-time high again so what happens in the meantime is you get this accumulation phase and awareness phase institutional phase and it's only the retail phase right at the end where most of the that's called dumb money in the retail money and and no offense to anybody listening many of you probably got in at some point right here the last cycle okay that's when it gets really heated but we're in this early early accumulation phase not even really the awareness phase at this point smart money accumulation this is where we want to be and this is why it doesn't matter that price is up a thousand or two thousand off the lows and it doesn't matter if you buy right now if it drops another thousand or two you're in the accumulation phase at some point what we're going to see i'm going to draw this backwards some point if we expect the next four year cycle low to go 150 weeks across okay again no absolutes here we're using just guides but if we take that and then we draw backwards a date and we want to go let's just say nine months back okay so we want to go 36 weeks this here is the point where it exceeds the prior highs so i'm going to draw from the 20 000 level to here this is the point where and again this is all guides i can't stress that enough where bitcoin probably exceeds the 20 000 level and begins to go parabolic and then from there does a 10x 15x whatever the number is nobody knows but this is the point 36 weeks from the top or around nine months give or take that it begins to exceed so then if we know that or if we believe that's roughly how it work and we can start to kind of draw this up right so first test back down another test another test and then go okay that here and again this is not very neat but it's not supposed to be you can look at the prior move here and the one before that you get these 60 day cycles of rally up above the bollinger bands back down up above the bollinger bands and back down for example it's going to be something similar to that probably get a nice shakeout a couple of shakeouts along the way as well so we see most of 2019 below and accumulating in under the six thousand dollar range at some point let's just say in october we get one spike maybe above okay it gets everybody excited come back down it's not until maybe towards december that we start to really put price above the six thousand and and then behind us okay um maybe a few retests lower and then early 2020 so let's just say a year from here we begin to get full awareness now now we have price over seven thousand uh getting up towards eight thousand it's now more than doubled if not tripled called getting closer tripled off the december lows people are starting to come back in that were probably invested at some point in the last cycle and now this is more of an awareness phase much more institutional money starting to come in okay probably an etf is approved by this point maybe a year out or so so we're starting to get a lot of interest now building in this but still retail does not believe now retail won't believe until we break 20 000 and cnbc comes on and talks about you know all-time highs and that all that type of thing it's all repeatable every cycle is the same okay but this then becomes a situation in 2020 where we start to fill the gap between that six seven thousand dollar range and the twenty thousand dollar all-time high of 2017. and that comes and completes all of 2020 and then into some of 2021 where 2021 is the third year and third year is typically the biggest year in a bull market at least the secular bull market and that's when the gains begin to get ridiculous so then what happens from that point is really anybody's guess my guess is that we have yet another similar move if not a bigger move in terms of percentage-wise than the last two i believe that the 2021 bull market top is going to be a massive blow off top like you've never seen before and i also believe and it's not for this video that that's going to mark the top of what is a 16-year cycle we see 16 17-year cycles in the equity markets and gold and many other markets and i believe that this will mark right here the top of a 16-year cycle so four of these four-year cycles this sorry about that this is the third then there'll be another fourth the fourth one i believe will be a massive four-year bear market but that's that's for later time that's for 2000 and sort of uh yeah 21 to worry about but i believe there'll be a four-year bear market going into the sort of mid 2020s decade but that's to come right here is where we get this massive blow off top and from here 10x from the 20 000 top and we've done 10x before from from the breakout point 10x to me is not much okay and 10x in bitcoin is 200 000 and 200 000 is only and this is rough numbers i believe around about 3.5 or 4 trillion dollars in market cap which obviously is a phenomenal amount right but now we're talking sort of 13 years 14 years into adoption and we're talking a much different game right here uh possibly and hopefully a massive light lightning uh technology adoption so we're talking about different environment we're talking about etfs we're talking about uh institution we're talking about 401ks involved a worldwide phenomenon at this point so we're looking here and i'm looking at least at the blow off top phase okay and then i believe 200 is the target um i would probably be out of a lot of my positions by that point but this could overshoot you know and that's obviously too much but this could overshoot i think possibly even as high as the 300 000 level is is is possible uh and not out of the uh at a question for what we're seeing right here then we can look at of course just like we have seen now i move back down now where does that move take us below if we look at prior bear markets around about 85 percent of the move is retraced okay but we always stay above the the top from the prior four year cycle so not that it's important right now but um this move if it got to 250 000 and 85 percent retracement brings bitcoin back to around about 36 000 so around about 36 000 in october of 2022 uh would be your four year cycle low it's probably uh actually i think november but in this time frame is the next four year cycle low drew at around about the 35 let's just say to 50 000 range so what's going to be important is that we are invested that we have our eye on the prize that we are accumulating we are taking profit at some points some minor profit but then that we are fully invested and also understanding of the next four year cycle and that we more importantly during this last phase here uh scaling out and not scaling in or not buying in and we're certainly taking up a huge amount of the profits up towards the top and only have a small amount you want to always have some bitcoin of course uh for the long term and forever but we want to be out for most of this because we don't want to ride like many of you did you don't want to ride another four year cycle low down 85 percent you don't want to be holding bitcoin from this level today at 4 000 to 200 000 and back to 30 000. okay that's going to be the goal for us over the next four years or the next three and a half years is to take advantage of this opportunity now does it have to work out this way it doesn't right we could be looking at a double top with 20 000 and then the next four year cycle low coming back down to 3 000 that's a possibility i don't want you to think that the cycle has to play out in this way i'm only telling you how i believe it's going to play out based on a longer time frame 16 year asset cycle and the fact that i believe we're still firmly in a secular bull market for bitcoin and under that scenario this is what i believe is the most likely outcome to play out and that's why we still have to be aware of the alternative possibilities we have to be aware that we could indeed be looking at sort of eight years of sideways chop right where it gets to 20 000 kind of does something like this it's possible and then the next eight years you get the point right it's more of a sideways chop that is a possibility which is why i keep saying when you invest today you're getting in near the bottom of a four-year cycle and that you're investing with money that you can afford not necessarily to lose nobody can afford to lose anything and nobody wants to lose anything but you're not betting everything on this right you're not going to cause catastrophic harm to you and your family by putting in way too much at this point because there's no point there's no need if we're going for a you know 30x move from this point or a hundred x move from this point you don't need to be more than let's just say 10 of your you know of your wealth allocated to this and that's even high you just don't need to okay because we're looking at such massive gains not only that if you're putting in too much capital at this point if you're if you're looking at the potential here and thinking about owning private islands and a suite of fast cars what's going to happen is you're not going to be able to ride the big capitulations or the big shakeouts that the market's going to give and there will be shakeouts and i'm talking about 20 and 30 percent corrections in bitcoin over this period at some point if not one at least one but if not one of you at least maybe two or three and if you're taking in the mindset that i'm going to put everything in right here then you're not going to be able to hold those gains you're going to basically give it back you're going to sell out at some point and then you're going to then you're going to be in an undesirable position that you're not going to have you're not going to be focused on the plan and the four-year cycle and you won't have the full position that you need okay so that is my summary that is my update since the last four-year cycle video this is overall to me very encouraging this is great news but keep your eye on the prize keep your eye on sort of the possibilities here for shakeouts but again like i've been saying in all my videos the last two months or three months you want to be from a long-term holders perspective fully allocated get your allocation now and be happy with that allocation be happy even if the market turns lower at this point be happy that we are in early during the accumulation phase of bitcoin thank

{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-03-28?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Fintech members. it's Bob Lucas Thursday morning in New York around about 7: 30 in the morning. I hope you're doing really well. this is your midweek update. going to be a quick update here on the cycles. let's look at the S&P to begin with. so we obviously have a top in the cycle right now. this looks like the top for the second daily cycle. there is an interpretation perhaps that this here is daily cycle number one around day 50 or so, kind of deep for my liking. we have seen we have seen the S&P make shorter cycles more often than longer cycles, which is the reason why I side with the day 31 interpretation. both of these are obviously either too short, somewhat somewhat too short, or somewhat too long for a cycle low. ideally, the cycle low would be in the middle here. it's not. the other reason why the day 51 cycle could could perhaps be it is that we have a nice correction down or a nice decline down into this area here. if I turn on the Bollinger Bands, you'll see that it came all the way back down, as opposed to this one here which would looks like more of a blimp than anything else. in that case it would make this little cluster here, the half cycle low. this would be the daily cycle low. it's really hard to say. I don't think it matters a whole lot in the end, because the half cycle low and the full cycle low kind of act in similar ways. and the reason why I also bring this up is if this here is the cycle low, then we're looking at the next cycle low coming up. this makes it early day 30s, day 32, for example, drop below 10 day moving average. an attempt to get back above the 10 day moving average that failed. now hanging on to the 10 day moving average, which in theory should then drop down and make a move to at least the half cycle low point right here or slightly below us, maybe slightly above. that would be the target. now, if this is the cycle low right here, then we're only on around about day 13. this, this drop, should be a little more shallower. that would be the half cycle low coming up into this area. obviously, if this is the full cycle low, then we do not want to drop below that. that would be a cycle failure. that would be a top for the entire investor cycle almost certainly, and that's not what we want to see. so a couple of different interpretations here. I think the overall takeaway, however, is that we're still in an uptrend, still looking- um, still looking for higher prices, I guess, unless we see a little firmer evidence that we you know that we are topping now. if, if this is the cycle low right here, this is the half cycle low. if we do get a decline down below the half cycle low point, that's also pretty bearish. it's not indicative of a top on the investor cycle, but it still is somewhat bearish as well. so I think bulls certainly want to hold this area right in here, above the. the low here at 27.22. that's a pretty far drop. anyway, that's an 80 point drop. I think if we dropped 80 points at this point and below, that is pretty much telling us that we could be looking at a top at the weekly cycle level as well. I think in this area right here I dropped around about 27.50. 27.55 on the S&P index would set us up for looking at a long trade potential. I would be looking for a swing low in this area. if we can get that over the next sort of three to five days. that puts this count at around about the day 40 mark. so everything would be pretty well aligned at that point if we get sort of a drop in this sort of zone here, um, I wasn't drawing that really well, I wanted the rectangle, um, let's see if I can get that back. so here's the rectangle, yeah, so kind of in this zone here, uh, over the next, let's just say, you know, five to ten trading days, or three to ten trading days, get a little drop into this area and then a swing and a reversal higher, that would be a buy for sure. all right, gold took a trade this morning. um got in. probably could have gotten in a little earlier. I wasn't, uh, wasn't really around yesterday, to be honest with you, in the afternoon, although I would have gone. I would have gotten in on the cross of the uh 10-day moving average. so I'm a little late to this entry here. uh, hopefully it doesn't hurt me in the end, but I think this is clearly a top. the only problem that we have is that if this is for some reason right- it doesn't look it. but if this is the investor cycle low, um, and this is a first daily cycle low, then we're going to be looking at um kind of a half cycle drop, probably only to around about the 12.90 area and then a strong move higher. I still want to favor what I've been covering in my reports, which is that you know this is just a very long extended cycle and we still need to see an an investor cycle low drop. in that case this, uh, this cycle low here, or at least worst case, this cycle low right here, which is a clear cycle low um, needs to be exceeded. we need to sort of get down into kind of this area here. probably bounce off this longer term kind of rising trend line that's around the 12.60 area, plenty of room lower, wouldn't cause a whole lot of technical damage, if any, and I think that would be maybe enough of a sentiment resetter to get the- you know to get- gold kind of going back up like this as well. hard to say, because again this has been acting, uh, very strangely with a lot of strength. so I do want to be mindful of being sort of caught short again. so my stop right now is at the open of this second candle, or yesterday, day before's candle, I should say, right around the 13.16 area. I am keen to get this down as quick as possible. there is a decent amount of gap right now between my entry and the stop here, but I need to give it that much room just in case it comes back up before dropping down. but again, like I said, I want to bring this down probably to at least the top of the wick of yesterday's candle- 13.12. I want to get that to that point quickly and then maybe even to the open around about what is that- 13.09 or so- and then, of course, if it keeps dropping, then we want to bring that stop down as quick as possible. um, let's take a. yeah, just taking a look at some of the, the juniors and some of the miners in general. I mean, I've never seen an investor cycle low in the miners that looks anything like this. so, again, this could just be telling us that there's a huge amount of strength here. it's just going to surprise us, kind of similar to the 2016 early 2016 mini bull market that we had in the, the miners and gold, where it just it didn't let you get in unless you were in and you managed to ride that. it just it, just you know, you just stayed that, that position. it could be something like that. um, hard to say. it looks like we have a big double bottom here. but I do want to see at least some type of drop, and this is not enough for me here, even though it's sort of 10- 10 for the miners is really nothing at all. uh, and look at the- uh, the seniors here the seniors are just showing a lot of strength. this decline here, uh, last week or two weeks ago, is just nothing on the on the chart here. so you know, I just would love to see some type of sort of punishment here. get us back down into this area here and then you can go. this is one of the reasons also why I still think the icl for gold is still ahead of us. but again, I will respect any price that we see in gold, any strength, and try and get out of the way. and if we do see a reversal in gold, then I would probably jump back on and go long for sure. for example, getting back up and above this 13- 20 area right here is extremely bullish and I would want to get long because at that point we would have at least a day 13, 15- I'm going to be sure what the count is- maybe day 18 high, and that's a first daily cycle for sure and I want to be in part of that. I don't want to, even though it may come back into a dcl. I'd want to be long because you just don't know what type of surprise and the upside you get from that point. taking a quick look at crude as well. so crude looks a little bit like the equities came out of this half cycle. low congestion or consolidation area popped up a decent amount, got to the 60 target that I that I had in mind for crude. looking at maybe even 62- it has not happened- has sort of double topped to some extent now below the 10 day moving average. I think this is going to come back and sort of test. I didn't want to do that sort of test. you know maybe this sort of 57 dollar area for the dcl but there's still, you know, crude moves, you know, in pretty extreme sort of fashion. so there is room all the way kind of down to the 55 area and even below. I mean this. this cycle low is all the way 51. so anywhere in this area or this range is sort of fair game for crude, as low as maybe even 50, sort of 350, 350, that's a. I mean I don't think it gets that low, but it's a potential, just got to be aware of that as a cycle low and then it can rally back up. who knows after that. it all depends on where we want to go in general with the equity markets and risk on in terms of how much further it can go in the next cycle. and then let's finish with the dollar dollar's doing the same thing: whipsaw up, down, up, down, up down. slight cycle failure here telling me that this move now will not make a new high. this is a reason why gold could really get get some momentum. but the question is, how much more does this go? I mean it could rally up, come back down and then go up again and then start to form the icl. it's still not that, not that advanced in the weekly cycle. we have an icl right here in january, so we do have potentially a couple of months, even to may or even june, before we can expect sort of a larger, this sort of decline. I think there is room. let me just redraw this here, let's get the tool out. there is room for something like kind of like this dcl right here and then kind of come down into the icl. numerous ways this can play. to be honest with you, even though we have a slight failure here that came on, some some significant sort of- I think it was jobs data or some some type of news- that pushed it down and it rallied back up. so don't necessarily put a huge amount of you know, of weight behind this being a dc, a daily cycle failure. we still are, in my opinion, up in an uptrend, even though, you know again, there was a sort of a slight failure right here. in general, though, the trend is slightly higher on the on the lows, certainly higher on the highs. so, um, still a little bullish overall on the dollar here, even though there is signs that we could be topping. and then, longer term, of course, this is still an uptrend and this looks like an ascending triangle to me, which would be a continuation pattern in an uptrend. so a lot of reasons to be sort of cautious here and, um, cautious that, in a sense, that don't expect a decline or a massive decline if you're long, if you're long gold or want to be long gold, for example, the dollar still is still king in my opinion. so I'm just, I'm just really playing it both ways, you know, having an open mind and where it can go all right. so that's the update. midweek update. I'll have a report out during the weekend, of course on Sunday. wishing you all the best, take care.", "source": "episode-2019-03-28"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-26?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members that's Bob Lucas Friday morning in New York I hope you're doing really well looking forward to the weekend so here is the newly new format for the lightning report this week I'm not going to go over 30 odd coins where I think most of you are not really paying attention to some of the most of these coins the format has changed as of Wednesday Wednesday becomes a top 10 market cap report all the top 10 coins reviewed in a little more detail both short term and long term then the Friday's report becomes the top 10 altcoins requested by you the members that way I'm only covering coins that I know people are interested in or requested and that will be done via the comments on the Wednesday's top 10 report you can then put in a request for the Friday report and by the looks of it there were six requests for different coins I'm going to cover today so I'm going to cover six of those coins I'm also going to cover Bitcoin as I always do and then I'm going to look through my list see if there's anything else I find of interest that you may want to put on your own watch list so let's go into Bitcoin all right so we had some pretty significant tether news from the New York Attorney General suing or you know basically stating that Bitfinex used a whole lot of tether reserves to cover losses that they had in the Bitfinex exchange not they're not suggesting this time that they are creating tether out of thin air or that it's not backed but that they used funds essentially from tether to cover losses so in the end probably not the most horrible news I guess and also at the moment still something that Bitfinex is going to reply to and it's not substantiated at this point so regardless of what happened it did cause a 10% decline in Bitcoin I'm not sure if that news warranted such a decline to be honest with you I think what we have more here is we had a tightening of the Bollinger Bands we had a lot less volatility and then the news driven event expanded that and created a cascading effect of declines now I did warn in an alert yesterday that we could be looking at the daily cycle top or the 60 day cycle top for this for Bitcoin it is possible that would be around about day 30 high not too bad considering we've been seeing shorter highs 18 and 9 and 27 we haven't had a 19 let's go back day 30 high last time we had one in a cycle was back in July so even even if it topped right here probably not the end of the world probably still looking at a retracement in that case sort of down like that right and into the next cycle low end of May that's not too bad that's that's within my expectation still so this is the this is kind of I wouldn't call the primary thesis that I have right now for where Bitcoin stands but something to certainly be aware of because we are below the 10 day moving average and the 20 day moving average and whenever that happens around the midpoint or the latter half of a cycle you really need to be careful and consider the fact that it may have topped already now that being said let's see how it responds over the next two days in the weekend if it bounces back from this point and rallies back over the 10 and 20 day moving average let's just say back of 53.50 for example then you know we could be looking at another leg higher and that would be very bullish I think that would be very bull market like behavior as well so let's just look out for that at this point though there's no point in trying to front run or trying to trade any one of these scenarios because it is kind of 50 50 right so if we get back above we could do this one more high around early May get up to that sort of 5800 area I've been talking about for a while which is the resistance which was the support but which should become resistance from the bear market 2018 period and then come back down in this case similar type of action I expect it'll come back down into this May cycle low maybe a little higher because it's higher coming from a higher spot hard to say but in the in the end kind of the same net result that I'm looking for regardless of what we're doing here in the short term so that's kind of how I see this market at the moment there always is the possibility that we even get even steeper of course just be aware of this again it doesn't really matter hodlers long-term guys we have our positions right we're set at this point that doesn't worry us we just we can maybe buy some more if it gets down to that area traders then if it breaks down sharply if it breaks below yesterday's lows and if it breaks below April 12th lows right here around 4900 then we have probably going to have a run on Bitcoin and obviously a top in place so we can look for a short but not until we get below 49 48 50 48 80 that type of area that's the only time we start looking for a short then we know we're well below the 10-day moving average we know we have a cycle top we'll be riding the lower Bollinger Bands at that point then we'll be in a short-term downtrend then we can look to sure at the moment there is no clear-cut path here for risking a lot of capital and therefore we are in a wait-and-see type of mode okay so that's the analysis for Bitcoin so a little bit of a change since during the week where I was looking at this uptrend now this uptrend for now at the moment is temporarily broken be aware of that that's a trend changer potentially again just play defense right now no no point in trying to swing at something here that's very difficult to hit okay first request is bat basic attention token looking good still chart looks beautiful still a nice rising 20-day moving average 10-day fairly fairly well above price still at the 10-day moving average we have kind of up down up down up so nice rising step up type of trend back at this area here which is sort of the highs from early April now back down becoming lows and testing that area I don't know if you want to be trading the alts right now this is the only problem but if you're going to be trading anything or if you're going to be holding anything right now bat is one of the strongest and this is this is the one you want to be holding okay so this one here looks like it's still going to continue higher hard to say though we still have a little bit of rollover in some of the technicals but again if you bought this or bought the breakout hold it do not sell this right now this still looks pretty good I think if it stays kind of while the price stays above this 10 and 20-day moving average I like to hold charts like this and keep going with it so nothing horrible about this this is probably one of the best looking charts and even when you extend long term out you see that it's clearly spent a year or so in this in this triangle here broken out now and showing some real good strength obviously bat has some some news as well with the enablement of being able to now tip and compensate more content providers and so forth so they've expanded on their their technology and delivered towards their roadmap I think this is also fueling a lot of this move so some of this may already be priced in some of this may eventually come and retrace back to the breakout point something to be aware of as well could go either way in that sense but overall a good looking chart and this is definitely a maintain a position or add on pullbacks as well all right raven coin seems to be a fan favorite but it is breaking down we I covered this in last week's lining report I put this line in here it's kind of like a get out right now this is breaking down this is in the downtrend there's no doubt about that at all a downtrend has been established high a low a high tested tested those lows came back up didn't make a new high came back down made new lows this now is in the downtrend this is an avoid I would not be trying to pick a bottom right here the next place you can pick a bottom it's actually not that far away now a 10 percent lower but I think this point here is significant it is kind of when it first listed on Binance like a week in back in October then we had this move in March to test came back down and then broke out with significant sort of you know style came back down now I think if it retests this breakout point kind of at the 900 area could be an opportunity to get long if it can reverse so what we look for is not just a touch to buy I don't think that gives you much but if we can get down and touch that line and then come back up and reverse then what you can do is you can buy kind of this area here and then use the breakout with a little bit of cushion as your stop as well so we're looking for a retest of this breakout point and then it can then maybe go higher again and start a new uptrend as well like this that would be the goal long-term holders I think you want to still hold this this is not not an unusual kind of pullback it did obviously I mean it's come from you know 250 300 Satoshi up to 1700 that's a massive move so this type of longer term retracement is not unusual when you see a pattern like this next request is for hot or hollow uh 25 Satoshi here this is a micro micro cap not doing anything I like at the moment this looked like a big consolation uh sort of a big pennant almost um but now more of a triangle it's breaking down so uh where do you put this line it looks like it should be somewhere like that broken down 25 Satoshi I think this is heading back down to this sort of 20 or 20 or 15 area in my opinion don't look at don't don't like anything about this chart to be perfectly honest with you unless it can come back and break this line here um the downtrend line here that's the only time there's anything positive to to be had in this type of chart next chart on the list is vet um this one here is coming back now pretty sharply uh like many of the altcoins showing at the moment so we had this big base that was good starting to come out didn't really do a whole lot although in percentage terms not too bad but this type of weakness we're seeing here on significant separation with the moving averages is showing a pretty significant downtrend here this is an avoid until these can find a new low kind of break um not that it's a defined uh downtrend like that but until it can kind of show a new pattern maybe show a low a high and then a new higher high and a higher low and a higher high so show us that's broken the trend there's really nothing to have here otherwise you just kind of you know try to catch a falling knife so to speak but right now it's much closer to the lows of december and january and february than it is anything else and for that reason i think we are going to probably bottom test all these areas here before it does anything so at the moment again this one is also an avoid the doge coin a fan favorite for sure but not looking good right now lost all the support from uh december january and february had a nice move recently of course but now it's below that so let's just look at a couple of important points here this sort of area here it's lost the november lows it is testing and then there are further lows before that so yeah this one kind of has its own you know this one here is a candidate for in the future doing some cycle work on because it has a very distinct community behind it and a very established community so i'm pretty sure if i dug deep into this one this could probably have some type of their own cycle pattern going and it looks kind of cyclical as well if you look at these kind of sharp troughs and peaks that it's showing here you know it possibly has something going there now long term wise i think you know so there's no there's no short-term trade from the moment unless it can kind of reverse and start maybe getting back about let me zoom back in get back above kind of this area here at 50 and keep going but if it gets down to this sort of 36 level i think this is a long-term buy and hold for sure because it has shown the ability to get up up into this 100 115 area which i think it will again at some point this this coin is not going anywhere it hasn't established history so long-term holders not a bad point even right now to get in at this one but definitely if it gets down to 36 or so for traders you think you want to look for a reversal and a swing before looking to get long so here's another request um covalent never heard of it never seen this chart before very first time looks uh relatively new at least on this exchange didn't see many other exchange options for it um not too bad i mean it started off here at a pretty high point so it's down 50 or 60 percent like a lot of them do when they newly list um looks to form kind of a bottom here now it's coming back up retesting you know i i don't know i don't know enough about this to give an honest opinion overall it looks like a media star to break to break down i think it has to recover this 10 and 20 day moving average and continue this trend so kind of put in the bottom almost right here and establish sort of a new trend like that if it can do that and get back above you can probably buy that and go along again from a trade standpoint just a trading standpoint i don't see any edge just looking at this chart to get long nothing strikes me as an opportunity for the person that requested this if they like the tech looking a long term that doesn't look too bad it looks like it's sort of found the bottom here it's come back a little bit not a bad spot to get in not a point to panic that's for sure so this overall doesn't look too bad from that perspective okay zen is one of my picks looking through my list this one here looks uh interesting not a buy yet but has some good volume and good price strength today i think if this here remains the bottom get it back above the 10 day moving average here we could be looking at a long opportunity so uh nice good sort of comeback off a nice uptrend if it can re-establish that it's a possible trade idea take a look at that and put on your watch list take a look at the altcoin market cap uh good breakout coming back lower this looks similar to a lot of the charts could be looking at now a balance off the initial breakout point which would be positive we could be looking at a continuation especially if bitcoin has topped it's possible that alts can at least hold their ground not necessarily rally uh against sort of like the usd but at least maybe uh outperform bitcoin in the coming and that would be very bullish because in the bear market when bitcoin dropped all coins got crushed and so in the bear market in the bull market when bitcoin drops the altcoins can outperform not saying it's going to happen but it's possible here that we're looking at kind of like a bounce now or maybe a near bottom you never know it could be looking at something like this as well that would be very bullish if we do get something like this and that would be very much confirmation that the bull market is back in because alt have now established a new uptrend as well but it's hard to say bitcoin dominance went pretty high very recently so it's a matter of just wait and see but this is where we want to see a lot of the bleeding stop in the altcoin space kind of in this area now the next couple of weeks otherwise it threatens to break back down market cap get below kind of the breakout point and then you really don't know what what you're dealing with but we do have to watch out you know we do have a lot of charts that are completely broken down look at xmr to to um you know monero to btc where i thought it was going to be a nice breakout from a triangle it's now reverse and making new lows not very good uh look at this one go chain making new lows nice surge high i got everybody excited now making new lows zrx looking uh looking like it might break down and making new lows as well you know zil breaking down new lows key self key breaking down new lows mkr was a good chart for a while there completely lost it now uh giving back 50 60 percent these are brutal these these all coins i mean they can make you a lot of btc a lot of usd but man if you hold them for too long and if you don't get out and take your profit you're going to get crushed and this is the lesson and and this should be the lesson for the next altcoin run and the one after that because it's going to be quite a few of them too many people make good money and they end up actually losing more than they made because they feel as if they get addicted to the gains and it's very difficult to divorce yourself emotionally from the gains and people go looking for more and more gains they keep buying the dips they keep buying the drops thinking that's going to continue like it did for them in the earlier part of the rally and of course it doesn't and then once they get into a very sort of negative position it's hard for them to close it out because it's in a lost position and they don't want to show a loss for whatever reason on their um you know on their account so this is just another example that a good looking chart that everybody's talking about doing really well and now doing horribly don't hold stuff like this cut your losses early put your stop losses in um you know it's okay to be wrong you're only you're only you're only gonna hold yourself accountable you're the only one in the end that's gonna judge um and you're the only one that's gonna look at your own performance and your win-loss ratio is meaningless the count balance is what matters in the end so just be aware of that okay all the best that's the lightning report for today hope you have a great weekend and i'll come out on monday with the next version of the bitcoin cycles report all the best to you", "source":

{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-02?", "input": "", "output": "Hello everyone. this is Bob Lucas. It is April, the 2nd in the morning here in New York and I hope you're all doing really well. So the Bitcoin four-year cycle is in. The December lows right here mark the end of the prior four-year cycle, A cycle that went for 52 weeks lower in a bear market and 153 weeks high and the bull uptrend for a total of 205 weeks, just three weeks short of a full four years. This video is an update to the four-year cycle video I published on YouTube around January 15th, A video that was recorded originally back in late December, right when we were looking at this decline here in early to mid-December. it was about a week or two short from this final capitulation here. I think a video was posted on one of these declines here right at the beginning of December. But this December low here on December 10th, or at least the week of December 10th, now marks what I believe with- and nothing's ever certain in trading and investing, but with a very, very high degree of certainty, or at least high degree of confidence- that the four-year cycle low has ended. That four-year cycle low comes at a perfect time in the four-year timing band at 205 weeks and really does not leave any further interpretation for a low to come in the future to make or complete the four-year cycle. If you had watched that video back in January, I did talk about the possibility that the February low, the 60-day cycle that was due, could exceed on the downside, the December low and then that would stretch down to become the four-year cycle low. But that hasn't happened. Instead, what we're seeing here is a whole lot of strength into this new four-year cycle and a move now, just today, above the prior to 60-day cycle highs. So this move today here on April the 2nd is essentially for me confirmation that this December low does mark the four-year cycle low. We've got too much separation in terms of price but, more importantly, too much separation in terms of time here for this move to be anything other than the beginning phase of a new four-year cycle For all your investors and hodlers out there. really, the four-year cycle is all for you and about you, and back in January I made it very clear, and in video since, that you don't want to be looking and waiting for further lows. We are deep enough and were deep enough in this bear market in terms of price, at an 85% decline from the high, and also in terms of time, as we already approached the four-year cycle time frame for the next low. This here was the opportunity to start accumulating and, as I said many times, to make sure that you have a fully loaded position, a position that you're comfortable with, a position that you can take higher and not risk essentially your livelihood and your family's livelihood, but enough of a position that would make the difference in the long run. Now it is absolutely way early at this point. It is not too late to be invested or fully invested. if you did not get and heed that warning and get your allocation correctly. It's only Bitcoin at the moment is only $1,000 essentially off. well, maybe $2,000 off the lows here, not even $2,000 off the lows. In the grand scheme of things, this is going to be kind of a rounding error to some extent, and it is not too late. At the same time, you don't need to panic right. there's probably going to be now a period of consolidation from this move and a sideways continuation of the sideways move, similar to what we saw when the last four-year cycle ended. So let's go back now four years- almost exactly four years right here- and pretty similar time frames, in fact, if you look at the end of the last four-year cycle coming off a 58-week bear market decline, you see this massive drop and good volume into January, as opposed to the recent low which was December, and then you had a nice sort of move higher, but then kind of a partial retest. it really wasn't a retest on the absolute capitulation price points there, but a retest at least to the closing point of the candles here, and then a nice rally higher, and this is kind of where we are right here. I think, if you can relate the same, if you can overlay this is a similar type of move here, where I think the market has a recognition. there was also a higher high that was kind of put in here the last time, and this is kind of recognition that the four-year- if we were tracking the four-year cycle- load back then in real time. this development is similar to what we're seeing now, where it kind of confirms a higher high structure in the market. now, similar though to today. I don't think we're going to escape at least without something similar to this, and this here, you know, scared the hell out of a lot of people back then it came down from. you know, it doesn't look like much here because we're dealing with a small number, essentially, but from a percentage standpoint, from 317 all the way down to a low of 198.. this decline here back in July of 2015 was almost 40 percent down to the bottom, which is obviously more than significant. this would have whipped many of the new bulls out of position. it would have whipped many of the people buying late- and it wasn't late, of course, in the grand scheme of things- but buying here after sort of a 40 or 50 percent move, these people here- probably a lot of people here- leverage a little too much or bought an over position, thinking that it's going to continue rapidly higher and then probably gave up a lot of that, puked a lot of this out right here before, then rallied and never looked back. now, if we go back to the current period here, this is probably something similar. a lot of people probably buying a lot of extra bitcoin right now, thinking that we are going to see something phenomenal like this occur. and hey, i never want to rule any possibility out in trading and investing, but i feel very, very strongly that this is not going to happen, not going to see anything like this and people who are buying with this type of view or scenario in mind are going to leverage up a little too much. they're going to buy way too much. they're probably going to either borrow- uh, maybe even use a credit card, for example- but essentially buy bitcoin with funds they can't afford to lose, and then what might happen instead- or what's more likely to happen at least- is that we get a lot of chopping. we may get some more higher prices, but we may even get something like this, okay, and this would come down into the next cycle low, uh, the 60-day cycle low- and then that type of move would punish anybody that's over leveraged right here in the short term. so the point of this is that if you're trading- sorry, if you're investing for the long term, if you have that four-year cycle, play in mind and don't overdo it right here. the type of potential and reward that we have ahead of us for the people who are patient over the next three to four years is so great that you don't need to be leveraging or risking too much capital right here. that's going to throw you off position if we do get a nasty shakeout. and if you look at the four year cycle low here, this was nasty, but this, to me, was perfectly expected. uh, i certainly was short the entire way, um, but we haven't since then had a nasty shakeout. so the last shakeout we had was five months ago. bitcoin and actually almost any asset class- if you look at gold as well, how it trades, it does like to inflict a maximum amount of pain on traders and investors and i don't see how we get above this eventually, above this six thousand dollar resistance area, without a major shakeout at some point. i'm not saying it's coming this week or next week or next month. it may not come until august, okay, um, we have to get through a number of these 60-day cycles still, but it's, i'm pretty confident in saying that at some point. and let's just draw out a few of these here. so we have a 60-day cycle, april. we're looking at another one, say in june. okay, we may not get, let's shake out here until august. so let's just draw in something like this- bear with me one second here- drawing in the highs and the lows. of course, all just hypotheticals here. all right, all looks great until we get shake out. so let's try and clean this up just a little bit here. all right, but the point is not for neatness. the point is to say that some point, maybe even as late as, let's just say, august, we get a 60-day shake out here. we get this really horrific. you know, one and a half thousand, two thousand dollar decline even- and that's perfectly normal in many regards in any market, whether it's a bull or bear market. but even in the bull market, you do get these nasty shakeouts. you know, one of the things that you're going to do is to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market. and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market. and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market. all these people that are just getting far too excited about the possibility ahead, buying way too much than they can they can handle, and then what ends up? what happening is that not only do they sell and capitulate on this fear and believe it's going to go down and break below the december lows, but they end up losing on the extra leverage and they end up losing their strong hand position, that bitcoin, that that position in bitcoin that they never was going to give up or didn't want to give up because of the panic and the fear and the amount of losses they're inflicting. so you end up in a situation where not only are you kind of out of bitcoin or have a very light load because of this type of sell-off, but you end up losing overall on the market and then something like this in a new four-year cycle, if it was to occur, is more likely to be a v-shaped recovery in price. so we would get a shake out, but then we would get an almost immediate bounce back back to the point where it started breaking down from, to begin testing that zone before maybe wanting to come back out and then begin a more sustained full market trend now that the accumulation phase is over. i also want to point out that, from a short-term standpoint and a trading standpoint, i'm able to flip between viewpoints on a daily chart rapidly. so i'm not going to give you- and i will refuse to give you, day-to-day views on where i think the market's going to go because, again, you know, i can be short one day and can be long the next day, so it's uh, it's pointless in doing that. so take a lot of these short-term lines and squiggles. i'm drawing um with that perspective in mind. these are guides. i like to focus on time. i am a time specialist more than anything else with, with the study of cycles, and the lines i'm drawing here are simply more for guiding purposes and nothing else. so you know i don't have a crystal ball here. um, i like to work with the time frame more than anything else. so we could also see, you know, a more immediate move lower back here, kind of get below here and then sort of chop sideways a little more and then come back into this point. i think, overall, what i want you to take away from from with this analysis is that i now firmly believe, uh, basically a 98 belief. right, because it's never a hundred percent once. once you go absolute and stick to an absolute statement, you're going to be- uh, you're going to be- screwed, essentially from a trading standpoint. you'll never be able to get away from that view and that bias and you'll be trapped, regardless of what price tells you, but i have a kind of a 98 confidence level now. that's the december cycle, low is in- and that we are now into a couple of daily cycles, 60 day cycles, into the four-year cycle. we are three or four months into the four-year cycle and the four-year cycle, if we look at the prior two cycles as our guide- i'm going to try and zoom out a little bit here- i believe will run for approximately 150 weeks. the prior two cycles ran for 153 weeks in the bull trend and the one before that zooming down- was 142 weeks. so again, just a guide, just an estimate for planning purposes. but looking at around 150 weeks to around the october 2021 time period, it's a lot of time right and a lot of room to move. so, lee, as an investor and a hodler, put that into perspective. how this market squiggles and wiggles and- and you know- also oscillates here over the next coming three or four months is irrelevant to you as a long-term investor. if you continuously are waking up in the morning and checking price, but you're a call yourself a long-term hodler, uh, or investor, then you're doing yourself a disservice by allowing price fluctuations in the short term to influence how you invest in the long term- very important concept. please try and really appreciate that statement and understand your time frame and be happy to be in that time frame from an investing standpoint and ignore what happens, just as you should have ignored this three, two thousand dollar decline. you're going to ignore to a large extent, even though you're going to be happier, of course- but you're going to ignore the one or two thousand dollar move higher because your prize is up here. your prize is a couple of years away and it is up here. okay, not designed to, not designed to get everybody really pumped up, but that's really the prize. that's what you're in this for. this is the four-year cycle horizon that we're looking at. so, um, again, let's see if we can kind of give give you. i'll give you an outlook to what i see potentially happening here over the next few months, and then maybe let's just stretch it out to the four-year cycle top. first thing, i believe, is that this six thousand or fifty eight hundred to six thousand dollar level on bitcoin is going to act as some significant resistance. it provided significant support on the way down in the bear market. there was repeated and repeated attempts to break below that. everybody thought that was going to hold and the market was going to go up. i did not and and i don't want to get into necessarily why at this point- but from a descending triangle standpoint i think the breakdown here was obvious. but at the same time there's going to be a lot of resistance at this point when it comes back up to test that area. i don't know when it comes to test that area, that's. that's the key or the problem right now. i don't know exactly when we test that point, but i think it'll happen sooner than later. we could even get that in the next week, we can get that in the next few days, we don't know. but let's just say, for argument's sake, we get up here and we test. that would just be the first test. i think at some point- and i'm just going to draw this in again again, loosely right- at some point, maybe around the august time frame, we get down and we- i don't think we- get anywhere near necessarily the december lows. we probably get closer to the february lows. okay, around about 33, 3400 um- again arbitrary numbers i'm throwing out, it's more about time. so i think we get down here and we scare the hell out of all the longs. they get worried that it's been kind of seven, eight months since the low. it's taken too long. it's now reversed lower. they start to panic, they're too leveraged and of course they get. they bail out. talked about that five minutes ago. let's move on here. then, i think, we come up and we kind of start testing this area a few times. now i don't know if we can get above that period, about that 6 000 point in 2019. i gotta be honest with you, we've got to be patient here. it takes time to build a solid foundation and a solid base in any new four-year cycle. but at some point we probably do get above this six thousand dollar level and once we get above that, we may drop quickly back down, but then we get it back above and then that same level begins to act as support, okay, and then we can begin to find an area that has, um, you know, less, less weight and, um, less friction, and we will then begin to accumulate or to begin to to rally higher with a little more intensity and velocity. okay, so when does the rally in the next four-year cycle really take hold? and what you notice here is that most of the gains in the four-year cycle occur right near the end and it occurs quickly and rapidly and very few people take full advantage of it and it's just too difficult to do. if we go back to the original four-year cycle, this is the breakout point right here in january of 2013.. the major top occurs in november of 2013.. 11 months from exceeding the prior high and then rallying, in this case from 13 or even like sort of 20 or 30 dollars here to 1 100.. that's the gain of the cycle in 11 months. then, if you look at the prior cycle and you look at the 1100 top from the first four-year cycle and you draw across, here's the breakout point. the breakout point occurs in april of 2017. think about that: april 2017 to december. now you're talking about only six months of, or seven months to, the next high. so from the april highs of around 1300 to 20 000- pretty much the entire gain. this is where new all-time highs come in right. so for approximately almost four years we don't have any new all-time highs and then we see a sort of 15x move occur in seven or eight months or 10 months. i'm sorry i keep confusing myself there, but you get the point. point is that most of the gains, the really big speculative gains, occur only once price hits a new, all-time high again. so what happens in the meantime is you get this accumulation phase and awareness phase, institutional phase, and it's only the retail phase, right at the end, where most of the that's called dumb money in the retail money and- and no offense to anybody listening- many of you probably got in at some point right here. the last cycle, okay, that's when it gets really heated. but we're in this early, early accumulation phase, not even really the awareness phase at this point. smart money accumulation- this is where we want to be and this is why it doesn't matter that price is up a thousand or two thousand off the lows and it doesn't matter if you buy right now. if it drops another thousand or two, you're in the accumulation phase at some point. what we're going to see, i'm going to draw this backwards some point. if we expect the next four year cycle low to go 150 weeks across, okay, again, no absolutes, here we're using just guides. but if we take that and then we draw backwards a date and we want to go, let's just say, nine months back, okay, so we want to go 36 weeks. this here is the point where it exceeds the prior highs. so i'm going to draw from the 20 000 level to here. this is the point where- and again, this is all guides, i can't stress that enough- where bitcoin probably exceeds the 20 000 level and begins to go parabolic and then from there does a 10x, 15x, whatever the number is, nobody knows, but this is the point: 36 weeks from the top, or around nine months give or take, that it begins to exceed. so then if we know that or if we believe that's roughly how it work and we can start to kind of draw this up right. so first test back down, another test, another test and then go. okay, that here and again. this is not very neat, but it's not supposed to be. you can look at the prior move here and the one before that. you get these 60 day cycles of rally up above the bollinger bands, back down, up above the bollinger bands and back down. for example- it's going to be something similar to that- probably get a nice shakeout, a couple of shakeouts along the way as well. so we see most of 2019 below and accumulating in under the six thousand dollar range. at some point- let's just say in october, we get one spike, maybe above. okay, it gets everybody excited. come back down. it's not until maybe towards december that we start to really put price above the six thousand and and then behind us, okay, um, maybe a few retests lower and then early 2020, so let's just say a year from here. we begin to get full awareness now. now we have price over seven thousand, uh, getting up towards eight thousand. it's now more than doubled, if not tripled, called getting closer, tripled off the december lows. people are starting to come back in that were probably invested at some point in the last cycle and now this is more of an awareness phase, much more institutional money starting to come in. okay, probably an etf is approved by this point, maybe a year out or so. so we're starting to get a lot of interest now building in this, but still retail does not believe. now retail won't believe until we break 20 000 and cnbc comes on and talks about, you know, all-time highs and that all that type of thing. it's all repeatable, every cycle is the same. okay, but this then becomes a situation in 2020 where we start to fill the gap between that six, seven thousand dollar range and the twenty thousand dollar all-time high of 2017.. and that comes and completes all of 2020 and then into some of 2021, where 2021 is the third year, and third year is typically the biggest year in a bull market- at least the secular bull market- and that's when the gains begin to get ridiculous. so then, what happens from that point is really anybody's guess. my guess is that we have yet another similar move, if not a bigger move in terms of percentage-wise than the last two. i believe that the 2021 bull market top is going to be a massive blow off top like you've never seen before, and i also believe- and it's not for this video- that that's going to mark the top of what is a 16-year cycle. we see 16 17-year cycles in the equity markets and gold and many other markets, and i believe that this will mark right here, the top of a 16-year cycle. so four of these four-year cycles- this, sorry about that, this is the third. then there'll be another fourth. the fourth one, i believe, will be a massive four-year bear market, but that's that's for later time, that's for 2000 and sort of- uh, yeah, 21 to worry about. but i believe there'll be a four-year bear market going into the sort of mid 2020s decade, but that's to come right here is where we get this massive blow off top and from here, 10x from the 20 000 top, and we've done 10x before- from from the breakout point, 10x to me is not much okay, and 10x in bitcoin is 200 000 and 200 000 is only- and this is rough numbers- i believe around about 3.5 or 4 trillion dollars in market cap, which obviously is a phenomenal amount, right. but now we're talking sort of 13 years, 14 years into adoption and we're talking a much different game right here: uh, possibly and hopefully a massive light lightning, uh technology adoption. so we're talking about different environment. we're talking about etfs, we're talking about uh institution. we're talking about 401ks involved, a worldwide phenomenon at this point. so we're looking here and i'm looking at least at the blow off top phase, okay, and then i believe 200 is the target. um, i would probably be out of a lot of my positions by that point, but this could overshoot, you know, and that's obviously too much, but this could overshoot, i think, possibly even as high as the 300 000 level is. is is possible, uh, and not out of the uh at a question for what we're seeing right here. then we can look at, of course, just like we have seen now, i move back down. now where does that move take us? below, if we look at prior bear markets, around about 85 percent of the move is retraced. okay, but we always stay above the the top from the prior four year cycle. so not that it's important right now, but, um, this move, if it got to 250 000 and 85 percent retracement, brings bitcoin back to around about 36 000. so around about 36 000 in october of 2022, uh, would be your four year cycle low. it's probably, uh, actually i think november, but in this time frame is the next four year cycle low drew at around about the 35, let's just say, to 50 000 range. so what's going to be important is that we are invested, that we have our eye on the prize that we are accumulating. we are taking profit at some points, some minor profit, but then that we are fully invested and also understanding of the next four year cycle and that we, more importantly, during this last phase here, uh scaling out and not scaling in or not buying in, and we're certainly taking up a huge amount of the profits up towards the top and only have a small amount. you want to always have some bitcoin, of course, uh, for the long term and forever. but we want to be out for most of this because we don't want to ride like many of you did. you don't want to ride another four year cycle low down 85 percent. you don't want to be holding bitcoin from this level today at 4 000 to 200 000 and back to 30 000.. okay, that's going to be the goal for us over the next four years, or the next three and a half years, is to take advantage of this opportunity now. does it have to work out this way? it doesn't right. we could be looking at a double top with 20 000 and then the next four year cycle low coming back down to 3 000. that's a possibility. i don't want you to think that the cycle has to play out in this way. i'm only telling you how i believe it's going to play out, based on a longer time frame- 16 year asset cycle- and the fact that i believe we're still firmly in a secular bull market for bitcoin and under that scenario, this is what i believe is the most likely outcome to play out, and that's why we still have to be aware of the alternative possibilities. we have to be aware that we could indeed be looking at sort of eight years of sideways chop right, where it gets to 20 000 kind of does something like this. it's possible- and then the next eight years, you get the point right. it's more of a sideways chop. that is a possibility, which is why i keep saying, when you invest today, you're getting in near the bottom of a four-year cycle and that you're investing with money that you can afford, not necessarily to lose. nobody can afford to lose anything and nobody wants to lose anything. but you're not betting everything on this, right. you're not going to cause catastrophic harm to you and your family by putting in way too much at this point, because there's no point, there's no need. if we're going for a- you know- 30x move from this point, or a hundred x move from this point, you don't need to be more than, let's just say, 10 of your you know, of your wealth allocated to this, and that's even high. you just don't need to, okay, because we're looking at such massive gains. not only that, if you're putting in too much capital at this point, if you're, if you're looking at the potential here and thinking about owning private islands and a suite of fast cars, what's going to happen is you're not going to be able to ride the big capitulations or the big shakeouts that the market's going to give- and there will be shakeouts- and i'm talking about 20 and 30 percent corrections in bitcoin over this period- at some point, if not one, at least one, but if not one of you, at least maybe two or three, and if you're taking in the mindset that i'm going to put everything in right here, then you're not going to be able to hold those gains. you're going to basically give it back. you're going to sell out at some point and then you're going to. then you're going to be in an undesirable position that you're not going to have. you're not going to be focused on the plan and the four-year cycle and you won't have the full position that you need. okay, so that is my summary. that is my update since the last four-year cycle video. this is, overall, to me very encouraging. this is great news. but keep your eye on the prize, keep your eye on sort of the possibilities here for shakeouts. but again, like i've been saying in all my videos the last two months or three months, you want to be, from a long-term holders perspective, fully allocated. get your allocation now and be happy with that allocation. be happy even if the market turns lower at this point. be happy that we are in early during the accumulation phase of bitcoin. thank you, guys. hit the like button. if you like this video, please subscribe. uh, please share this video on on social media or anywhere you like. get the message out and i look forward to coming out with some more videos on long-term holding and investing. all the best to you. wishing

{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-03-04?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas. it is Monday morning in New York. I hope you're all doing really well and had a great weekend. gonna cover the Bitcoin cycle today and quickly go over what we could be looking at in the altcoin space. unfortunately, I think the kind of the bearish presentation I made last week is playing out as I expected. we did not get a little bump as I thought we might get, but we definitely are moving lower at this point. we seemed to have kind of we seem to be breaking down now from this consolidation period. that looks a little bit like a bear flag. my concern was that, after a big decline like we had last week on the 24th of February, that we would, after a period of consolidation, continue the trend lower. it certainly looks that way at the moment, unfortunately. I think the next real opportunity for Bitcoin to rise is going to be in the second half of this cycle. I talked about how a 60-day cycle has, you know, two sort of halves to it. we are now on day 26 of the cycle, so we are approaching that midpoint and it's pretty logical now, looking at this chart, that we do have a day 18 high in place, at least for the first half of this cycle, and that we're now moving down into that first half cycle low of this 60-day cycle. so I don't know where that takes us. looking at the chart, and you can kind of ignore this- this was, this is leftover from my last video where I was showing the bear the bullish opportunity. that still is an opportunity right now, but I'm just going to erase that for the time being and pretty much look at this and say, okay, day 26, we have roughly four days to a midpoint. so anywhere between kind of today and next eight days we can expect kind of a half cycle low. I think that half cycle low does not break down below this cluster of of candles that we had from the early portion of the cycle. I think that will act as too much support in any type of decline. but that's not that far, far below. that's only around 200 below. so it could get exceeded on an intraday basis. but I think what we're going to see now is sort of this: move lower a couple of days, maybe four days. let's just say, for argument's sake, the midpoint, 30 days. then I think we get our rally in the second half of the cycle now, based on the structure of this, the way it looks, I don't think it can exceed in this 60 day cycle the two current highs that we have showing here for 2019. well, that's that one's late 2018, but, but in the last sort of two months, right, I don't think we can exceed that. we could. it's a possibility and that would set the scene for a possible or for a likely right translated cycle, meaning that we exceed the high, exceeds the midpoint, which means the next low would probably stay above this low, and that would be a good start for potentially some good accumulation and then some gradual improvement over 2019. but for now, I think we have to stay defensive. we do have, you know, a huge downtrend behind us. we still have 14 months of of sort of bearish prices. we don't have solid or clear evidence that we have a new sort of- you know that the bear market has ended or the four-year cycles, and so we do have to stay defensive. there's no way about it, and that's also why I've been saying the last week: I don't want to trade this environment. this is a chopping environment. trading this environment is only going to lead to, for the most part, a series of smaller losses that are going to start to add up very quickly and that's why I've stayed away. I've kept my balance sheet clean. there was no rule opportunity as far as I'm concerned. what I was looking for, if we were going to be really bullish, was, after a couple of days here in consolidation, to rally up. take out this day 18 high, make another high, and that would put me in a very bullish mindset. at the moment I'm definitely leading more bearish, but I also don't want to short because it's still only on day 26 of the cycle. I only want to short from day 40 and beyond. that's when the cycle is most likely to collapse. that's where being short it can be rewarding and the surprises would more likely come to the downside. I think what we're looking for again is the half cycle, low decline, I think. then we rally back up, we get people excited, we exceed- most likely exceed- this Feb 28 candle that's sticking up and that high is 38.97. so let's just say 3,900. I think we end up between 39 and sort of 42 somewhere in this vicinity, somewhere around day 40. let's just say: and so let's just draw that in, and then I think we start to chop and I think we move sideways, then it all depends on where does this want to go right? does it want to make a new low for the February cycle low? does it want to sort of chop and and find support, kind of in this lower 34 to 3600 area, like the last cycle did? if that's the case, and that would become a very wide base of accumulation that could, for the next cycle beyond April, really help out and really provide the basis for the next sustained move, which hopefully at that point will come up into the fourth higher four thousand dollar range, even the five thousand dollar range. again, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done here. it's not constructive enough for me to to be bullish in any way, and again we need to see how Bitcoin responds, coming out of the half cycle low into the second half of the cycle, okay, but otherwise I think it's still a bearish overall, sort of a bearish. look, we would hope that this February the sixth low holds in the coming cycle low, something like that. okay, that would be, that would be fine. you know, that's just like I said many times. we are in that sort of crypto bear market winter period, even though we may be in a new four year cycle. we're still in that I'm just accumulating phase. there's still a lot of selling pressure, still a lot of projects that are bleeding, a lot of crypto, a lot of ethereum, a lot of cash. they need to be selling what coins they have. the miners are sort of struggling a little bit. they need to keep selling. there's just still a lot of pressure coming out of the bear market at the moment and there's still a lot of selling pressure here to be absorbed and that's something I've been talking about since the December lows. right, don't expect a massive rally at any point until we absorb all of this action. I did say back in December that April is probably the cycle low. even if it's not going to be a new price low, it's probably the cycle low where things can maybe start to really improve and we start to get some upside momentum and where we can probably start to break out of this kind of range here from the lows- 3100 up to sort of 4200, this area. here a couple of cycles would be enough to paint a. you know, paint, paint the chart and and complete the sort of accumulation for this stage to get it up into this next sort of zone here. so that's what I'm looking at the moment. again, the markets can always surprise, right, we can always rally up from here, break this day 18 high, form a high in the day 30s or 40 range, and that just changes the perspective or the picture entirely. but until I see that, I have to respect what I'm seeing on the chart. I have to expect the price action, respect the price action, and therefore I just can't be long or even short at this point. but I'm in definitely, you know, sort of a wait and see patience mode. at the moment. I prefer to be sitting in cash, so to speak, and in this case, being in sort of a stable coin, for example for my trading account. right, from a long-term perspective, definitely fully invested. I like this zone. I don't think we get much more of a discount in waiting. of course we could always get lower prices briefly in in April, but long-term holders, you should be fully invested at this point. and then I'm going to quickly just go. look at Ethereum. all the old coins don't look great. there are some exceptions, of course, but in general, like Ethereum, as I as I alluded here last week, it's breaking down. that tells me that the alts are going to lead down as well tells me that we're not ready to rally overall. all right, the space had its move here. it is here. it was big, it was healthy, but it was short-lived right and I always said: in a bear market or in a negative sort of environment, the rallies are short and steep and then you get the sell-offs right. so that's where a left translated cycle is all about. you get the, you get a good third of a cycle, then you get two thirds in a declining phase. so we just need to be patient. we need to work through this period. the. the light is definitely at the end of the tunnel, but we still need to be more patient. there's still more work to be done here. it's going to take a little bit more time. Ethereum to the dollar, exactly as I had hoped, or as I, as I had shown, didn't even get that little pop that I thought we would. it's just rolled over. clearly here. this is a top of some type. it's the half cycle top. no doubt. do we go into the half cycle low here? do we rally back up and then where does it go from there? okay, that's the question. looking at the structure of the chart. you know, I think we we probably roll over again, just like I said for Bitcoin, roll over in this sort of area right over here, and then come down and form the cycle low. I do believe, though, that this December low for Ethereum is going to hold. I believe that's going to be the bear market low, but again, right, if price comes down and takes it out, then I accept it and I move on. that's just the nature of trading. okay, it's good to have an opinion, but let's not get- let's not get- too hung up on these sort of predictions or opinions, especially like something like that, where it doesn't necessarily matter from a trading standpoint. I took a look at some of the other ones as well. they're all kind of similar. Litecoin is still holding up, still the strongest of them all. this would be a good buy at the next cycle low in April, just as it was a good buy here, even though it surprised everybody pretty much and and maybe left a lot of people behind and not being able to take a position. but I think, as it comes down into the April low, Litecoin is going to be one of those, one of those alts that you probably want to be long into the new cycle for sure, just based on the way it's it's strength over the last two cycles at the moment. okay, so that's the update for this week. I'll come out with a midweek update on Wednesday, in two days time. I'm actually going to post a public post, probably this afternoon, something I did on YouTube on sort of huddling and having a strategy for the really long term. I just I just edited, edited out that video. I'm going to publish that as a public post. so please look out for that as well. otherwise, I hope you're all doing really well. leave some comments in the section below and I'm sure to get back to you as soon as possible. all the best.", "source": "episode-2019-03-04"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-10?", "input": "", "output": "Hey, good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas, Wednesday morning in New York. hope you're all doing really well. this is your brief midweek update on the cycles. had a full report out on Monday. I suggest you go and check that one out. that one has more detail on the daily and, more importantly, the weekly chart. but right now, a couple days have passed- still some more consolidation, I think overall this chart still looks pretty good to me. I'm sorry I know a lot of people were starting to get bearish or concerned that we might drop. at the moment the chart looks fine. it's it's holding up well. I think it's consolidating. a couple of big candles that we saw early in the cycle up well above the Bollinger Bands now come back into the Bollinger Bands, I think, still consolidating. so overall it's an early cycle count. it is showing some very good strength overall. the only negative, I guess, is that I do think we have a ceiling still in play with this kind of $6,000 or $58 to $6,000 area. I do think that would be a ceiling, but that still is more than 10% above our range right now. so I do think there is time and there is certainly room price-wise for this cycle to fill in kind of this gap here all the way up to the $6,000 area. now, of course, it doesn't have to test that $6,000 or $5,800 area in this cycle, but just because we have broken out of this, this multiple cycle zone here and now that we're in this- let's call it- no man's land, where there really wasn't a whole lot of price discovery, if you look back in November we only had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight trading days in this 42 to 5800 range, which is $1,500 range. that is not a lot. there is no real significant support or resistance in this area right now. so it can and probably will sort of fluctuate in this area. I would think I don't think there's an immediate danger of it retracing all the way down. if it does, then it's probably going to be more something like this, where it's just going to do more of a back test of this breakout and then come back up again one more time before coming back down to the cycle low. this is kind of how I think it's going to play out right now. of course, no crystal ball, but this is just. I think we're in this extra zone here above, above this tight trading range that we had. but keeping in mind, overall, that we're still in, we're still in kind of those crypt, that crypto winter phase, even though we're beginning to kind of come out of it a little bit, we're still going to be, we still should be, kind of trapped in this below trapped in this below six thousand dollar range, I think for some, for some time to come, and maybe even all the way out to to kind of the the later months of the year, definitely into the fall autumn of this year, I think we don't get up and above six thousand. so that, that being said, I think we still continue to chop around. we just need to pick our spots from a, from a trading standpoint where we leverage up is going to be important because we don't again have a clear range or clear trend. I should say, although now for me, where my bias back in January was for a downtrend bias for a bear market downtrend, where I was holding my shorts longer, more keen to get into shorts, and if I was going long I was sort of keen to take profit early, I'm no longer thinking that way. I'm thinking I'm more biased now to the upside, although I don't have a bear, a bull market sort of trend bias on me at the moment. but I do think that we are now in more of a an accumulation uptrend than we are anything else and for that reason I am more willing in my trades to let them ride a little longer, move the profit targets out further, take less profit, I guess, further up front and just give give trades in general a little more room to give me more, more profit. so that's kind of how I'm thinking and approaching the trading at the moment. but you know I'm looking for a leverage trade on Bitcoin. I don't see it right now because, like I said before, we could retrace back fairly easily and still be very bullish and could easily still go up and test that $5,800 area. that doesn't give me a whole lot of room here to- at least you know, to get positioned behind any one of these sort of scenarios, whether it's long or short. so I prefer to just sit on my hands when it comes to Bitcoin for now and let something develop a little more clearly and cleanly for me to enter into. I think where there is some opportunity is probably in Ethereum. Ethereum did very little during this last kind of it's called Altcoin pump, even though it wasn't anything significant. it didn't do much at all. but now it seems like, when everything else has sort of settled down somewhat, Ethereum is making a move. now I'm looking at this more against the dollar at the moment and we definitely have an ascending triangle that has broken out. I like this breakout. so I've taken a long position versus the dollar, looking at maybe getting a nice big move up to around about the $240 area, but maybe even at least the $200 area, which is it could be another 10-15% from here, take some profit around there and then maybe let the other the other half ride up towards $220-$225.. I like this chart a lot. it looks pretty clean to me and it can and does support- that's why my stops are fairly low at the moment. it does support a potential move back to kind of this $162 area before making that move up. that's also a possibility. but I do like the, the structure of this chart and the nature of this chart. I've taken kind of the, the longer or the widest portion of the triangle and applied that going forward up here and it kind of projects a $240 range. when you look at Ethereum further out in the scale versus the dollar, $240 really is peanuts, even even kind of. this area here, where it broke down right in November, is $222. this little peak here is $257. so getting back to this area doesn't do a whole lot. it's not like it's going to be a ridiculously, you know, significant move or anything like that. getting back into that zone, if you zoom out is, is pretty insignificant and not that surprising, I guess. if you look at the fact or if you believe the idea that December marked the four-year cycle low, I think this looks like a decent setup to me. so I'm long this for now. let's just see how it goes. my entry was a little late. I actually got in a little earlier slightly, but then then my alert was posted. but still, ideally the the right spot would have been probably more around the $170- $172 area once there was sort of three or four percent separation from the breakout point. that would have been the ideal spot. but I'm still comfortable because there is a decent amount of upside potential here. so the rewards aspect of it is pretty good. allowing me to just say: okay, I'm still going to take this trade and see where it takes me. 156 right now is sorry. 153 is below this candle right here. 156 is right below this candle here. so it is. if I zoom in, my stop right now is mirrored on this bottom of this candle right now, right here. so that gives the. that gives the free the flexibility to come back and retest the breakout point. and the breakout point is not exactly clear because there is a little bit of action over here. but this candle here and sort of this candle here gives us some room. anything below 156 probably is not of any interest anymore and at that point would be below the 10 and probably the 20 day moving average as well. so that would be a point to get out. so this is what I'm doing here with with ethereum, and then I posted that I got out of the Monero Bitcoin trade, just wasn't doing anything, guys, and I'm not afraid to close a position for a for a loss. I prefer a partial loss than a full loss on the position. but also it clears my mind. I don't have to babysit it, I don't have to watch it, I don't have to let it sort of play on my mind here. the fact that my initial thesis was the breakout of this triangle and it came back in gave a little time here to sort of get back and recover and then just languish for another four days since. so for me that's that's a pattern that's no longer working. so why be in a position at that point? clean up your trades, close them out, who cares if it's a technically a loss on the scoreboard? a smaller loss is better than a larger loss. that's the way I see it. capital first, win loss ratio is kind of irrelevant. when, when, when, when. really capital and capital in your balance, capital in your account, is really what's more important. and then the other open traders: Tron versus the dollar. TRX broke slightly above the. it's not really a breakout point necessarily, but just using the- the highest here back in January and February. it has a nice structure. this is the highest point you can draw. you can even draw a kind of get some of these other peaks over here. I think it has made a move higher. it looks really good. there's a very deep base, so I took a long just based on that. let's see how it goes. gonna give it some some time here to develop and it does have a nice run over the last couple of weeks. it is already up around 20 or 30 percent. so it's not like it's early. but I do love the base that we have here and I do like the fact that it has well a lot of significant room up to the upside. first target would probably be around about. I would say that, you know, maybe this up this area up here where these two candles are so more like the point zero three eight, point zero three nine, maybe even close to the four cent range as well. so just keeping an eye on this for now, just to see how it goes, hopefully to move higher, we can move up our stops closer and closer, to break even as quick as possible, but for now just just giving this a chance. I talked about ADA in the past. I still have a small long position around a third that I'm going to keep and wherever it goes it goes. it's pulled back, healthy pullback over the last seven days and maybe now it's sort of coming back up. this is the original line that I drew, so it's come back to this point. let's see maybe it can go higher. if it does go higher from here and maybe come up towards recent highs, then I can really move up my stuff even more again. but this last final third that I have is a patient position and that's the type of position I'm going to let ride and hopefully we can see Cardena come all the way up to sort of this 2400 and maybe even the 3000 level over the next month or two. so that's more of a longer term. let's just call it intermediate term play. now that I've taken out a couple of good profit points from this trade, let the rest ride and see what it can give us. if it's a good, if it's a bull market in play right now, something like Cardeno could really do well, I think, going forward and this can be a significantly big winner. but worst case, it's going to close out for not so much of a loss. so that's what I see here on Cardeno. somebody made a special request for XRP. XRP still continues doing the downtrend, if anything. if you look at the Bollinger Bands here, we're starting to hug the bottom of the bands. we ask continuously weak. this is a very weak bearish chart in my opinion, and I've been talking about this being in a downtrend for the longest time and it's pretty much been occurring. look at this trend line that I had drawn- many you know- some time ago. it was kind of hugging that trend line and now you see separation between that trend line as it moves to the downside and now it's definitely hugging the bottom of the Bollinger Bands here. so it's pushing a couple. you know it's pushing a standard deviation there, still going lower, looking weak. I don't know where this goes, but I can definitely see a maybe a double bottom with this October low, maybe even below that. there isn't much of a trend, but the short term, the more recent trend, is definitely down. so for me there isn't anything too uh, too exciting about this trade, about this, about this coin, at the moment at all. and lastly, let's look at total market cap, again, excluding bitcoin. I like this chart, this one I've. I think I'm going to be focusing a lot more on when it comes to the altcoin space, altcoins- here, this is just purely from a dollar perspective, so it eliminates the bitcoin noise, it eliminates the pricing in bitcoin. and so total market cap- all crypto excluding bitcoin- doing really well, broken out, seems like we have a bottom in place, we have a reversal and now we have a consolidation. here. uh, could move slightly lower, but then it looks like we have a new trend high at this point. so I'm very encouraged by this. I think this is very good news for the entire space, good news for 2019, good news for potential bull market coming at the end of the year and next year overall. looking, uh, looking, promising. okay, my friends, that is the midweek update. I hope you enjoyed it, as always. any questions, post them below. my next update will be on friday, which will be a pretty extensive covering of 30 plus coins, the lightning round. look forward to it. until then, be well happy trading. watch the risk. thank you.", "source": "episode-2019-04-10"}
{"instruction": "What did Bob discuss about market cycles on 2019-04-22?", "input": "", "output": "Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas coming from New York, Monday morning. It is the 22nd of April. Hope you had a great weekend and I want to wish you all a good trading week coming up. So let's get stuck into it really quickly. This is going to be a Bitcoin cycles report as we do every Monday, mostly focusing on Bitcoin, going to cover the daily chart and the weekly chart and let's have a look at what of interest we see. So firstly on the daily chart, very little change of course. We have very, very narrow candles here on the daily. We have the last kind of five not moving much intraday, very little volatility. I think volume is relatively light and we're starting to see the Bollinger Bands now coming from the big expansion that we saw out of this surprise cycle. Low starting to come together again now as we've had about two weeks of sideways trending action. So I think what this is telling us here is that we will probably constrict a little more. I think I mentioned that last week, how we could probably just just move sideways for a little more to the point where they get really tight and then ready to go up higher for another move. Overall, I don't see a whole lot to be bearish about at the moment. I know a lot of people are bearish or are maybe concerned that we're going to see another downtrend and another decline. At the moment, I just don't see any evidence of that. Of course, anything had happened. I always I always preface anything I say with anything can happen. But for the time being, again, it's the same analysis, right? Longer term since December, let's call that intermediate term. Since December, we have at least one higher high coming from the cycle highs. So this one will be a higher high no matter what guaranteed. And we have at least two cycle lows that are higher than the previous ones. And there's a good chance that the next one will also be higher as well. So that is the definition of an uptrend. We are still in the relatively early parts of this daily cycle or the 60-day cycle. We're only around day 22 or 23. Of course, where we market is a little bit difficult to determine at the moment. But that's irrelevant. It really is because this is an upside surprise. This is a cycle low in this area without really forming a price low. Those are the most bullish types. I've also talked about that in the past. So now we have this move higher. I really do feel that we want to form a right translated cycle, meaning the top occurs past the midpoint when measured from one green arrow to the next green arrow. Those green arrows are the cycle lows. A right translated cycle is an uptrend. I want to see one. I think we're going to see one. The previous two cycles were actually surprisingly left translated even though the lows stayed above the prior low. And that is really the definition of accumulation where we've got all this selling pressure and the cycle is declining. But there's way too much accumulation here that's keeping the market afloat, keeping it well supported and well bid. And then eventually when all that selling pressure is gone from that cycle and then price can naturally increase because you had the same level of accumulation that comes in. Then of course, as the cycle begins to top, you then have more selling come in and then the same thing happens. The second time it happened though, the selling pressure was relieved earlier. There was more accumulation and then boom, it's led to another explosion higher. So you see that pattern reoccurring. That's really what cycles are about. Cycles measure and give you that underlying either weakness or strength in the market. Right now, it's telling us, in my opinion, that we have a lot of strength here. It's building up and I think we're going to get this big move higher. It may not exceed the $6,000 level. I don't know. This is my primary outlook. This is the way I'm positioning and looking at this market. Then we get to this area. That's going to get everybody very bullish. And I think then we can finally drop down and then look for the next 60-day cycle low towards the end of May, basically another month away from now, maybe even a little more than that as well. We have had a couple of very short cycles or fairly short cycles recently, 53 days, and then something between 47 and 54 days. Both of those are on the short side, which means in theory, to start to equal these out or even these out, we may even get a cycle low in sort of mid-June as well to compensate or overcompensate. So around the day 65 to day 70 area as well. That's something to look out for. Still a few, obviously over a month away from that, but that's something we will be paying attention to once we get down back into this area. Let's take a look at the weekly chart of Bitcoin. And so far, it's looking like a nice big bottom for the bear market itself. Four-year cycle low in December is looking more and more as if it's a sure thing. I would say it is close to it, definitely in a 90% probability range as far as I'm concerned. We are now looking to test the bottom of this support area during the bear market. I think what we're doing here is we're still consolidating for the next move. For me on the weekly, this looks very nice. The 10-week moving average, which we, if you look at this since the top back in January, and once we traded below the 10-week moving average, price only came back to the 10-week moving average a few times. And those were at the tops of the 60-day cycles. And they would spend no more than kind of a week, some cases just intra-week, some cases maybe two weeks, like here for example and here. But in each time you spend, price spends most of the time below the 10-week moving average. And the other thing you'll notice is the 10-week moving average in a bear market is mostly declining. I think right now we're looking at the bottom of the 10-week moving average. Now we're seeing the 10-week moving average start to increase. We also note the separation between the 10-week moving average. Got a little too far ahead of itself right here. And I think what we're doing here, instead of coming back in terms of price to touch the 10-week moving average, we now have it sort of trending sideways as the 10-week moving average begins to sort of catch up. I think we're going to start and we're going to get into the zone. I think we're going to get to around about 62 maybe, 6300 even. We could surprise even more. But then I think we get back down and back below the 10-week moving average. So similar to the decline where the 10-week moving average price comes up and pierces it on the high in a bull market. And let's go back here to the 2017 period. See here, in a bull market, 10-week moving average is moving higher. Price stays above it for most of the cycle. And then during the decline, comes down and pierces the 10-week moving average. In every case, just about same happens in reverse and the decline. The only caveat here for this is that we may be trending sideways for a longer period of time, kind of like what we saw right here. But still, point being is that I think we're going to see price spend more time above the 10-week moving average than below it, which means the 10-week moving average should continue to sort of trend higher. Maybe not at this sort of steepness, but it will continue to move higher as Bitcoin begins to sort of come out of this bear market bottom, start to get price above the $6,000 range and start to put in right-translated 60-day cycles, which is the definition of an uptrend. So let's turn on even like the Bollinger Bands, for example. Yeah, so this took us above the upper Bollinger Bands. We haven't been above the upper Bollinger Bands since 2017 or 18 on the weekly level. This took us above, this candle here was entirely above the Bollinger Bands, so we do need to sort of consolidate somewhat. And I think that's what we're doing here. We're consolidating into the Bollinger Bands again, with a 10-week moving average, catch up some more, and then some of the excessive bullish sentiment and overbought conditions will start to relax, and then that can allow price to go higher again. Going back to the daily chart, I don't think we're going to escape at some point at least a good shakeout, and that shakeout, like in every market, can go for longer and deeper than most people expect or want to see. So just be aware of that, and that can happen at any time at some point in the next sort of few weeks. I don't see it coming now. If it does, that's a little more bearish than I would have liked because this cycle has not really been enough sort of right translated for me to be comfortable. So if it starts breaking down from here and starts spinning below the 10 and 20 day moving average, I think that would be a danger point because that would mark this as the high, and that's only sort of a day 10 to day 15 high, similar to what we had over here. And that could mean that we're going to see a much more pronounced decline, maybe even all the way back down to this sort of 3200 level, and even lower down to the December low. That would mean that we're going to see or we would see that double bottom or that test of the lows earlier than I thought and more so in May, as opposed to something like maybe in July or the summer months where I think we may get a really steep test of the bear market lows before then allowing for a big bull market to develop. Okay, let's just take a couple look a couple of other sort of random coins Ethereum because I am long Ethereum versus the dollar hasn't hasn't gone highest. It's tried a couple of times. It's really holding the line. Look at the 10 and 20 day moving average zooming in a little more really together. Now, it's kind of like getting to the point where you get the band, the bands are getting tight. It's going to get to the point where you think it's going to either go higher sharply or lower sharply, of course, meaning more volatility. Still long this still like the chart still think it can go higher. But of course, any any move back down to kind of this 158 area is a reason to get out that wouldn't then that would mean the pattern is probably broken and starting to come back down to test the bottom of the triangle down here. So just staying long for now. I still like the chart just patient be very patient. I'm not trying to I'm not over leveraged. I can handle a move down to 158. It gets me stopped out. So be it if that's the case. But right now, because I think the upside potential is all the way up to sort of 235. I can just be patient and wait here with a smaller position because any move up here, I'm going to be able to hold and I'm going to be able to profit from if it gets up there and the the risk reward is much higher up here in this area. So just be patient with this guys. There's nothing to nothing to do but wait and watch. Take a look at a couple of the other charts I've posted in the past. EOS still looks pretty good to me. It's come all the way back down. Hasn't sort of I thought if it gets below the $5 level, it'd be an issue. It got to 501. Still looks valid to me. The bands are getting very tight like they did here and here. I think the uptrend continues. I like EOS versus the dollar still. I think Litecoin dollar is in a very similar position. Coming down now, threatening to break down, getting really at that danger zone area. But I still think this is a healthy consolidation after all these step ups that we've seen over the last four or five months. I think this can still go higher and continue the trend from this point. ADA has pulled back probably a little more than I would have liked. Again, I'm out from a trading position. I've banked on my profit. Still have a long position I'm going to hold unless this initial neckline breaks. Too much separation here from the neckline last month to coming back to watch this break down and then start losing on the position. So I won't do that. But still think that it could reverse higher. But again, I don't like the amount of pullback we've seen here. It could mean that we've seen a top for the intermediate level here. Especially obviously if the altcoin space is not going to continue rallying, then this is showing us that we're going to get back down into this bottom area. XRP still looks very bearish. It's actually done exactly what I've said it would for the last two months. Continuous decline, consistent. Then it started back in the beginning of the month to really begin to accelerate those declines. We had a pretty big drop below the Bollinger Bands and that explained that big move back higher. Continued much lower. At this point, I mean, what can I tell you guys? People ask me all the time whether this is something to buy or to trade. There's nothing to buy right here. This is not a good looking trend. It's been down since December where you see most of the altcoins found their bottom. A lot of them did. XRP kind of found its top. So it's almost like it's inversely trading to the overall crypto market. So yeah, I mean, if the altcoins find a bit of a top here and decline for the next month, maybe XRP rallies back up a little bit. And also it's a type of coin that can do something like this very sharply, but you can't position yourself for something like this. I mean, you look at these charts and people may claim they made money on that, but the only money they made is if they were already in the position and rode that all the way down. I've pretty much been telling you to avoid this and that would have saved you quite a considerable amount if you did avoid it. It doesn't mean though that you want to be positioned here in case it does rally up sharply because the trend and the chart is telling us that it wants to continue lower and lower and lower. And there's really no bottom in something like this because there's so many coins that are issued. It has shown the ability to get all the way down to this 4000 level here and actually in fact back in December to 1000 level. So there is an unlimited almost amount of downside potential here. So my only analysis here is if you like Ripple from a long term, I don't personally, but if you do, I'm not going to judge, then maybe from a value standpoint getting some here, some position here or sort of cost averaging in now that it's at this lower level is maybe not a bad idea. Don't overdo it. But from a trading standpoint, there's really nothing here except for maybe staying short or being short because the trend is lower and you always want to stick with the trend where it is clear like it is here. Let's just finish off with bat real quick. Putting the load out around about 40% lower from this price. Hit an amazing, I think my last alert sort of said take some profit if you could around this area. It might have even been a little below this. Did hit looks like 93 hundred overnight or yesterday. Pretty amazing. This looks like it's well look, these type of charts as we know in the crypto space can continue for seemingly, you know, beyond anybody's expectation. So there's no reason why this would not or could not continue. I like this one from a longer term perspective. Have a position in it. Took some profit as well. I think this is a good spot if you have not taken any profit in your long to take some, I think on a pullback say down to maybe the 10 or 20 day moving average is a good point, a good point to maybe get some more position as it pulls back. But this is the type of thing that it's now kind of running if you look at it from February, since it's real low here. The fact that it was above the September lows, this is the most positive thing and now it's broken out and this could run for for much higher as well. So this one I like still take some profit if you're long from well before as well. Okay guys, that's your weekly Bitcoin cycles update. I hope you enjoyed it. Leave me any questions that you have. I'll come out with a midweek update on Wednesday. All the best to you.", "source": "episode-2019-04-22"}
