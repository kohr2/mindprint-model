Hello Fintap members. It's Bob Lucas. It is Saturday here in New York on the 22nd and this is your weekly report. Firstly, I have not received any negative reviews on this new format of recording the screen images I provide in the report and providing some narrative. I've also received a number of positive remarks so I'm assuming this format is working out well and for me it's working out fairly well as well so I'll continue this going forward and we'll just see how it goes from this point going forward. So let's get stuck into it starting with gold and the rally is continuing nicely here. We had slight pause below that prior investor cycle high here from the February high. It took around about a week or so and then it just shot higher from there. I mean this overall is just very bullish action. If we consider the fact that in the first portion of the daily cycle we've run a hundred and around about 140 I think it is to the tip. $140 is what you get out of some entire investor cycles so we have the $140 out of the first daily cycle. We are though up to day 24 I believe in the cycle and first daily cycles I think they average around day 26 for a top especially in the bull markets around about 27 days so we're at that topping point right now. We are above the Bollinger Bands. We are somewhat overbought or consistently significantly overbought you would think. So a couple of things here I wouldn't be surprised if we go another two or three days higher maybe to 14.20, 14.25 that would really leave a lot of people behind but I think at some point here soon we're going to get a pretty quick and sharp snapback to the 10 day moving average and then go again. I don't think though that this becomes anything significant. Well at least it shouldn't. I think if this breakout is legit and gold has found some type of multi-year low then or at least multi-year highs here that's going to be sustainable into a larger degree rally then I think this this this in theory shouldn't pull back for too long or for an extended period of time. I think this is the type of market action that just goes. So I think any pullback would just be enough to serve for the purpose of slightly resetting sentiment shaking out some some some significantly leveraged positions that have now been built up and then come back here form the cycle low maybe over just a three or four day decline only and then continue higher and then we could also see in the next cycle another $130 rally for example and that from let's just say a 1370 cycle lower position somewhere around in this area would get us up to around $1500 in a flash in just another three weeks or so and that that would be very surprising for many people I think for us kind of waiting here at that waiting for that 1370 resistance area to break I think now that it's broken I don't think any of us will be surprised with that so I want to try and be positioned for something like that at least to try and capture as much of that as possible if indeed it rolls out that way if it doesn't begins to break down then we'll have to just adjust you know just adjust and take it as it comes but for now it all looks very good here and the daily chart again looks hot I love the way this looks I love how sharp and how powerful this move has been and we weren't we didn't have a significant short position built up against gold where you could say this is just pure short covering because it's not we've already flipped the cot report over to the other extreme so this is not short covering this is actual people coming in and leveraging up or buying up so I think this is for now at least sustainable just a matter of you know kind of how do they how does it wiggle and how does it swing back and forth on the way higher the second chart I cover in the report is the gdx miners and I mean this is just picture perfect it's nearly vertical here we know that the miners can can and do often when they get into this type of zone or this type of mode they just keep on going at the weekly level looks to be somewhat well not looks to be it is somewhat overbought but again overbought in a bull run especially for the miners is a is an irrelevant type of indicator or metric that to me only tells me that more can come now if we do get that gold first daily cycle pull back over three or four days and I can see this sort of coming back maybe by five maybe even ten percent I mean it can do that very rapidly of course as we see on the way up it can do that on the way down but don't discount this don't lose position I think we need to hold position here in the miners I did sell a little bit here maybe even prematurely I think on Thursday half the position but that's just the way it goes I just need to hold the rest of the position all the way through the first daily cycle and because I don't want to try and time the rest of the position in this cycle and then miss out and let this run away from me so nothing nothing really to do in terms of my trade or position if anything if we get a good pullback over say a five day period I may add a second position but right now it looks a little too extended for me to get comfortable with that especially with the first daily cycle that's looming and then we have the gold weekly chart and and this just looks really good and you know I've talked so long about I mean maybe it's been two years now about this resistance area here and how we keep coming up against it and how we did come up against it so often and talked about the base that was developing I know this is a very commonly shared chart on social media and other places but I've been talking about it and I don't think I was the first but my point is that I've been talking about it well before the mainstream we're talking about the the foundation that has been built and the fact that in 2016 I believe we had the final bear market low and that's now being proven so this was just the accumulation phase of the next eight year cycle we should now with this breakout here be looking possibly at a quick pullback and again just same type of analysis on the from the daily chart we don't want pullbacks to kind of linger then come and come back below this what was this resistance area we just wanted to just keep on going at this point create some separation prove to the market that this is now a bona fide massive breakout and let's see if we can get gold up to 1500 even 1600 but I think ultimately this is the beginning now of a move that's eventually going to make its way all the way back to the 1900 all-time high tops that we saw in 2011. It may take another two three and rest the cycles but I believe we're now going to head towards that area with a little more authority and strength in this market so overall I do like what I see in gold here maybe wishing we're going to have more of a position maybe looking at a dip here to add a little more but look still positioned well caught a big big amount of the move already so overall looks pretty good and just staying patient with this one all right now let's move on to equities here and hopefully I'm not going to lose some of you on the cycle picture here maybe some of the newer folks I may lose and I apologize I'm going to try and be as precise as possible we have essentially a cycle count that can go a few different ways it is abnormal for sure and what I mean by that is we had what looked like a very clear 44 day cycle low we see the the indicators kind of confirming that but not confirming that in a real serious way but for me because the cycle count was on the day 44 area that was enough for me to say okay that's the cycle low so since we came up we only barely broke the 10 day moving average and then came down and failed so for me this was a failed cycle and then my assumption was that because it was a failed cycle we had crude oil breaking down sharply as well that once we pulled up from here once we hit the 10 or 20 day moving average we would roll back over and that's where I was stopped out of my trade using that narrative but right now I it's hard to say whether this is still the case because if this is a day 44 cycle low and we have a failed cycle it's almost impossible then to see a failed cycle go on to make new all-time highs and to go above the prior cycle it's not some people don't like to even mark their cycles like that they say it's impossible for me there's no such thing as impossible when it comes to cycles it is just the price action that we see ahead of us however I think now a better fit is to say that this is a day 58 cycle low so somewhat stretched the indicator is a little more favorable towards that and then this here is a new either a new day it's definitely a new daily cycle in that case but the question then becomes and I'll get to that in the weekly chart does this also become a not so much a shortened but a true daily cycle investor cycle and because both of them would be a little longer than normal 50 days and 58 this would be enough to be one full investor cycle now because we have new all-time highs coming up or we already have new to all-time highs as of friday we're looking at just the first daily cycle here and we're off to make some significant highs there's a number of different versions that in in in what I just described which makes it difficult for me to get solidly behind any one of those or to risk a lot of capital in either direction but overall I think now I've gone I've actually flipped I've gone 180 from a bearish narrative from this outcome here to now with all-time highs having a bullish narrative it's it's really hard when a market makes all-time highs to look at that and try and find a negative in that there are cycle interpretations here where it is negative for example this is just cycle low and this is the third cycle and we just make a slight new high and then we get this blue line down that would be perfectly normal but again anytime we make new all-time highs in any market you want to you want to think it's bullish at least so that's why I'm sort of sidelined here because I'm just looking for the market here to tell us exactly what the cycle outlook or cycle market cycle was is really telling us and I'm going to show that on the weekly I think it's a little clearer on the weekly okay so on the weekly chart here's what I'm talking about with the 24 week cycle low 24 may seem short but actually in the past 24 weeks so around six months was about normal for a cycle it's just been the last four or five years where we've been seeing so many cycles in the 30 to 35 week range has been a little strange but this is kind of normal here and the reason why I don't think this would be a third daily cycle so part of the same cycle is because this just seems too powerful for a third daily cycle within the investor cycle and also the way it broke significantly below the 10-week moving average and then now reclaimed the 10-week moving average that's just be very very strange for this to roll back over again to me this is telling me that this is a new cycle we're only in week three or week four starting and then it wants to go higher and then when you look at the backdrop of almost a year and a half of consolidation and this almost is like an inverse head and shoulders right here it probably makes some sense that we could be looking at another rally here at this point i think everyone is so focused on the economic weakness or at least some of the weakness some of the some of the weakness we're seeing in some of the the surveys some of the numbers and trying to extrapolate that that means recession but i think with the fed coming out and kind of reassuring the market that they're going to be ahead of this and on top of this and lower rates fairly quickly is giving the market some encouragement enthusiasm here to keep it well bid and i think that's really what this is all about right here this here is all about the fed uh it's pretty much realization that the fed is going to get aggressive is going to get involved and the market's going to go higher as a result the last chart i provided is a monthly view haven't looked at a monthly in a long time but the monthly here is showing uh a pretty significant bullish engulfing candle here after a pretty significant bearish candle so um the bearish candle got everybody all the bears excited and this this bullish candle here seems like it's gonna get all the balls excited but this type of bullish engulfing candle on a monthly now of course the month's not over so it does still need to confirm but if we do push a little bit higher from here it's going to be one beautiful bullish engulfing candle after a bearish one and uh this to me with an investor cycle low uh recapturing kind of a six month monthly trend here this tells me that this market could be primed to go very very much higher from here the last time we had this type of consolidation was back in this area here in 15 16 and then we had this run that just went almost ballistic but in a sustained manner there's a lot of pent-up energy right here a lot of a lot of momentum that could be unleashed if it does break out to new all-time highs um it seems almost impossible that the market could go higher from here i mean people talk about valuations and other economic indicators but the market doesn't seem to care the fed is behind this market so again i'm leaning bullish reallocated some back into sort of ira accounts into longer term mutual funds as well so i went back from a pretty heavy bond positioned and actually they those have done very well themselves so i haven't really missed anything but actually reallocating back to sort of a 50 level back into the stocks as well from just from a long-term perspective don't want to be missing out on a potential big blow off from here at this point so the stocks overall like i said some mixed cycle um scenarios are in play still could have a bearish outcome from this but now i think uh we want to be like mindful of that and not be overly bearish or some people just stuck on this bearish narrative for life and i don't think i don't think that's healthy and it's not going to help in this case all right let's move on to crude oil all right when it comes to crude i'm really happy that we were able to i think extract almost maximum gains out of this cycle it was a pretty good position in my opinion we got out uh the first time kind of in this 53 dollar area if i recall second time maybe 52 dollar area uh actually was a little higher it was around about yeah around 53 dollars again i believe anyway we've got this nice reversal here we've got a short looking cycle 25 days i think this matches up with what i just showed you in the equity markets i believe we have a three cycle play here and an investor cycle low uh not as clear cut but we do we did get some pretty oversold readings we have a really nice swing in indicators so it's really likely that we have at the minimum a 25 day cycle low to me this is definitely a cycle low we have a nice break higher massive separation of the um of price to the 10 day moving average and like i've said in the past when crude gets in a trend it stays in that trend until it reverses and this was a pretty dominant trend on the way down and the fact that it's now trending up means that this trend is is finished and this cycle also must have ended as a result um so the question is is this a fourth cycle that's going to roll over and i don't think so based on the amount of strength that we have here and also the cot report is looking very bullish for gold again sorry for for crude oil again so i think we have the makings just like i said in the equity market that this is a first daily cycle and that we're going to continue higher okay not as much confirmation of a new investor cycle looking at the weekly chart we are still below a declining 10 day moving average so this at the moment still looks a little bit of a counter trend move but again if the equity market has made an investor cycle low based on kind of a fed narrative then it looks like or we should expect crude to also have found an investor cycle low like it did back in december when the market rallied um so if if the crew equities are going to all-time highs and and going beyond in a new ice ice then this also should be a new ic we had more than enough of a downside decline here we touched the bollinger bands a couple of times the lower weekly bollinger bands we had a decent sell-off in the rsi here at the weekly level um we are kind of spoiled by this decline here and comparing it to that and thinking well you know we still maybe have more ahead but this was a crash of pretty epic proportions uh this here is a very normal looking icl so for me i want to think i want to think this is an icl and call this a 24-week cycle low at this point just of course from the back of my mind mindful of fact that we could still have one more decline but i think that's more of a sort of a 20 percent possibility and this is more of an 80 percent possibility that we do have a new cycle in play all right dollar analysis i'm happy to to say that this one i got perfectly right um and in fact uh it's not not a boast i think it's just that cycles have been very very consistent in the dollar we're seeing very consistent 16 to 20 day cycles with sort of 8 to 10 day tops and they've just been perfect so this one was not hard for me to call especially because i was looking for a final daily cycle i was looking for a top to occur early and this this line has been drawn weeks ago and it's basically almost perfect here at least to the top it is uh pretty significant drop here i think we probably get a little bounce and this is what maybe forces gold into a quick and shallow first daily cycle load but i think this is still a little early in the cycle that we could still have another six or eight days lower and that could help gold as well not grossly oversold either although we are below the bollinger bands but for me now obviously look at the 10 day moving average starting to really come down after the uptrend we are now into the final stage of the investor cycle decline so um the losses can get steeper and the sell-off can be more aggressive like it has more like it was the last three days and then we see here a breakdown of i'm not sure if it is support this is the dollar index after all it's not a actual forex pair uh it's a it's a basket of currencies so um this probably doesn't play much for in terms of a support area but it's still notable that uh overall the basket is breaking down now the only thing that's going to save it right here is an icl and then a new rally but um i have a sneak sneaky suspicion that this may be is the start of a i'm not going to call a crash i know the gold bulls love to to call for dollar crashes but at least uh this here being a significant cycle three-year cycle low maybe have one or two investor cycles lower maybe get down to kind of the 92 level 93 over another investor cycle but of course we would need a rally first out of this icl but then for pretty quickly from there i think that's also very possible and i think that's what gives gold its legs over the next maybe six months or so but takeaway here is that we're are we are in a decline we're four weeks into the ic decline could go a couple more weeks before finding some type of low probably well below the weekly bologna bans and then rally up for two three four weeks and then maybe look at a left translated investor cycle which we have not seen since i think 2017. so we are overdue for a left translated cycle and a failed cycle at that so keeping an eye on that but that's still a number of weeks away before we would see evidence of something like that not sure where i left it off last week with bitcoin but um this has been a you know an amazing run um i've been long bitcoin for about uh six or seven days now coming out of this move um actually longer than that it was at the 8400 level um looking for this breakout looking for a move to up to 12 or even 12 and a half thousand dollars based on previous moves that were very similar overall bitcoin is in a massive massive uptrend rally here and doesn't look like it wants to end anytime soon i posted a video on youtube recently um and i think i'll try and share this in the report that talks about the long term um long-term hold strategy here for bitcoin and and the fact that i believe that just there is not enough bitcoin going around there's not enough supply in this market and with institutional investors getting in and coming in they're driving the price up very very rapidly so overall this is now extended that could pull back we've had something like you know nine or 10 green candles out of 11 but again the way this market has behaved and has rallied in the past and also based on the where this breakout occurs we could be looking at another thousand dollars or even more before it tops for the intermediate level and then comes back down so um not something you can do right now you can't get long this market here it's just too extended uh if you are long though you probably want to hold your positions put some stops in at least a day maybe using the candle a day or two before and then just keep riding this until the market reverses giving it some leeway and getting stopped out so that's the analysis on bitcoin just a quick update there overall very bullish thank you and have a good weekend all the best to you
