Hey good morning Fintac members it's Bob Lucas it is Thursday morning on the 20th of June around 7 30 a.m here in New York I hope you're all doing really well this is a midweek update quickly go over the charts here after the Fed meeting so pretty exciting news I guess I mean I'm not surprised I'm not sure the market or anybody really ultimately is surprised but essentially it looks like we're now going to go through a rate cut cycle or at least a couple of cuts over this remainder of this year the Fed has again signaled essentially that they want to support the market I think overall from a macro or long-term standpoint this is bearish news in the sense that it's an admission that the economy is stalling or not doing so well the market is reacting positively and I guess the narrative there is that a couple of Fed cuts will I guess save the economy save the save the macro environment from stalling and falling over into recession I'm not as convinced because we do have headwinds from the tax cuts now kind of baked in year over year the trade wars that are going on I don't see those ending especially with an election cycle coming up they seem to be a political more of a political sort of statement than anything else but I think they're creating headwinds for the macro economy overall so I think the only thing that can maybe save this economy is a big sort of spending infrastructure bill that may come through congress at some point this year I don't know but that's the only thing in my opinion that would save it a couple of rate cuts will not do that but for the short term at least markets are up markets are bullish they want to go higher it's pretty unusual to see talk of rate cuts when the market is at all-time highs or only one percent off all-time highs but that's the environment we're in at the moment and we just have to respect it and go with the flow but looking at gold gold has been up for weeks now in anticipation of this I think gold here is telling us that there is excuse me a flight to safety there is a risk off movement as well that's why the bond market is screaming higher yields are down for the same reason of course inversely to the bond market rally but gold here looks beautiful obviously the cot report is not so good looking but I think that's also a function of just the amount of people getting in to this market I think the cot report should be ignored for the short term not the long term but the short term I think this market can go higher although we are getting close to probably the first daily cycle high had a big spike overnight at 1394 it looks like 1393 close to 1394 that's a huge move off the lows at 1270 so we already have a 120 move um in the first daily cycle almost what we did for the entire investor cycle I think in the last uh the last move from August I think overall this is beautiful news I think this breakout here from this long-term and this is probably the most watched chart on social media right now but the long-term resistance area there around about the 1360 to 1370 area has for now broken we would like to see a little more separation maybe a move above 1400 then probably a snap back in the first daily cycle low back to the breakout point would be ideal would be textbook we get that move back shake out all the late comers here uh so a good 40 move back down to the breakout point form the first dcl and then go higher again I think silver gets the move um percentage wise bigger than gold at this point it is behind it is only just starting to get going and we know once it gets going it can just keep on going I think the target would be the short-term target will be up to the highs of the last cycle around about 16 20. so that's still around about a five or six percent move which is significant for for silver and then ultimately we could in this cycle get all the way up as to sort of the 17 to 18 range as well when you zoom out you know we know we know silver can do that during big moves something like this right here I know this was kind of the bear market low rally back in 2015-16 but this just illustrates just how fast and how far silver can go once it really gets going I think it's too early and I think silver might be the way to play this going forward so again overall the precious metals look great maybe dufo pull back soon miners have done well as well as you know long the miners long silver right here long gold in my personal accounts took some options on those as well but for now all looks good just stay patient with it watch for the shakeouts don't get pulled out of position on shakeouts and let's just see where that goes equity markets so uh let's look that's the S&P that's the spot market uh so ES looking at new all-time highs on the open here by the looks of it um yeah it's close to if not right at all-time highs this is not going to be a double top this looks now like it's going to go through here it's I'm not sure what this is from a cycle perspective I've talked about and let me go back to the spot because that's where I have the markings so this to me uh I'm going to have to reassess over the weekend and do some more analysis on what this potentially means um but we've had we've had similar markets like this and every time it's fooled us with us with a failed cycle or what looks like a failed cycle in real time and gone on to make new highs it's been very bullish in those types of cases so this could be very bullish this could also be a second daily cycle though again from a cycle perspective it's not really should be marked that way um too extended and we do have sort of a somewhat of a clear uh cycle count on the cycle low so again I think I need some time to assess this but I think overall this is bullish and it could be pointing to maybe some type of blow off top and I've talked about blow off top over the years many times um but because we have sort of a what is it one year one and a half year consolidation in this area we could be looking at sort of a final move that really gets going and goes far even a 10 move which is not much for this market gets us up to around about the 13 30 area sort of up sorry 3300 area uh and that that could be something that this market is willing or ready to do right now I don't know it's hard to say so when you go back to the peak of January 2018 we're about a year and a half of sort of sideways mostly sideways movement only a few percent gain to the two tops here so you have these three peaks and if we break out of those three peaks I think that market then rips higher significantly so um not a time to be short in the market not a time to be um out of the market as well long-term perspective I think it's time to reload um and see where this market takes us uh crude oil I think crude oil was a great trade to get out uh just in time on a 10-day break I was going to wait for the market to exceed this January 10th high luckily I didn't save me quite a bit because now we're roaring higher again and it looks like crude in in the worst of cases is going to make a move up to sort of this point here around the 60 area then we see if it wants to go higher or whether or not this is some type of just you know some type of trap and goes back lower but for now definitely short term is moving higher um and this could also be a long play for for some of you definitely in the futures markets I think this even though it is off off the lows significantly already I think this has the momentum now and the type of reversal in place where it could easily get back up to the 60 area and then lastly the dollar is providing a lot of headway so a lot of tailwind for the crude move and of course the dollar uh the gold move and there you go so we were looking for and waiting for a cycle top we now do have that cycle top in play we're definitely in my opinion going to see a failed cycle very soon once we see the failed cycle I think we get back down down into this area here and we will be heading down into the next investor cycle low at the weekly cycle level so this is driving a lot of the commodity um rallies what we're seeing today as well as of course the uh the bullish fed statement as well both of those are providing a significant tailwind for the market and I don't see it ending just with today's move so overall pretty bullish from a price perspective across the board I think you want to you don't want to get in front of that you don't want to be you know discounting or shorting that move you want to be riding that move so that's the midweek update I'll have a weekend report as usual I hope you've enjoyed it thank you very much
