Good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas. it is Thursday morning here in New York, the 16th of May, and this is your top 10 market cap report. I hope you're all doing really well. so we had a really nice week here in New York with the consensus conference. we were there the entire three days. we actually had a set up there, a booth set up, and that was nice to meet a lot of people in the industry. I gotta tell you there's a really nice buzz this year. last year and the year before was much more- let's call it- sort of scammy- ICO, ICO scammy and speculative. this year the vibe was certainly much more constructive and it did appear from from a lot of the companies I was speaking with that we had sort of much more of a viable industry that's been developing here and a lot of the technology that was being built had some better use cases, I guess, and and it had- at least from what I can tell- some viability for survival, as opposed to last year, where it just seemed like there was the craziest or silliest ideas that were had already been funded or were looking to be funded via the ICO sort of channel, and it was clear that people were there simply to sort of sweep up some money and speculate on tokens. so definitely some positive vibes and feedback that I got from the conference. we certainly had a great time. Peter Brandt was down. he spoke at the event. I think that would be available on the coin desk website at some point. it was a really nice speech. we also had Dean see the light come down. we had Mark Dukas come down and then our fireside chat with tour de mister. that was also great. that's going to be available, I believe, on the website next week. so we- you know we- and I think was big Jonas was also down. so we had a great, great week here in New York. I think there's a lot to be excited about. obviously, seeing price at 8,000 and above is an amazing development. clearly- and I'll go over it very shortly- probably due for a good little pullback, but regardless, the chart looks phenomenal. the lows look like there almost certainly in lots to be, lots to look forward to, a lot to be excited about. there's a long way to go here, but you know we all stuck through this. most of you and most of the founders who have been on the platform for almost a year now. you know it was tough back there, but you know, hopefully I think we got you through that. I think all the analysts were fairly much talking about being very defensive or shorting or being in USDT things like that- throughout the bear market and then coming out of the bear market in December and January. I think we were pretty quick to get on board to sort of the long thesis here. so overall we've gone through the absolute worst of that. it's it's it's a past, the case of light, the end of the tunnel. we now have the light. we're out of the tunnel. it's just a matter of now navigating the sort of early portion of a of a bull market that could get a little choppy, could get more volatile here until it starts finding a nice trend. and when that trend starts to develop on a more intermediate time frame and weekly time frame, I think we're going to be very happy and excited with what we have ahead of us. so that's the the kind of the update. let's get into the bitcoin cycle. so right now we are sitting on day 52 of the half of the cycle. it is right, translated clearly, we probably looking at a more like a day 70 cycle, something like that, because of the fact that we're already up to day 52, we still have the declining portion of the cycle to go. we also had two fairly short cycles previous to this one. so typically, or sometimes, what happens is when we have a shorter cycle it's followed by longer cycles to make up for that time, and we have two shorter cycles so we could see more like a day 70 cycle, which- and I'm not calling a top here, I'm just using kind of more logic than anything else- this has been. it's not parabolic, but it kind of has a short-term parabolic feel to it. it's just trapped, you know trapped people trying to. you know FOMO in getting in. there's just too much demand here, not enough people selling, and it's push price significantly higher. we could see another little leg high. I thought actually before I thought yesterday at the four hour chart. I'm gonna see if I can flip that to the four hour chart here. I thought the four hour chart if you ignore the last two candles here. I thought this: this was consolidating really nicely here for another move. I'm not sure if it's doing that anymore because it looks like it may finally be rolling over, as you can see here, below the 10 bar and 20 bar moving average for the four hour candles looks like it may be starting to break down right now, but it's done that a couple times, it did that right here and did it over here. but this one is a little more, I think, meaningful because you know, we kind of had the highs or the push here two days ago and then, even though we broke higher- I think it was overnight at some point- it only did that intra candle and now it looks like it could be breaking lower. I think this kind of 76 candle here, 70- yeah, I think it's 76- 18 on bitstamp, that candle there closing below that kind of on a four hour basis candle, and this is very short-term nature I'm talking here. it's probably going to lead to a confirmation of the cycle top. so if it does do that, something like this, and then I think we have that top and then let's flip back out to a daily yeah, so obviously it's gonna be a little too steep there. so then on a daily we could be looking at that fairly, fairly quick move back down. 10 and 20 day moving average should definitely be lost in the cycle low and whenever that comes up and then just looking at targets here don't get too, I mean if you're looking to get long. so so here let's break it down a little bit more here. if you're looking to get long, from a long-term standpoint, if you want more exposure, you're kind of waiting for the exposure and this move kind of took you, took you by surprise. then you don't want to get too cute here, because we're looking at, you know, 15, 20 000 beyond bitcoin and maybe even in in, maybe at the end of this year. you don't want to be getting too cute on your entry. if you miss the entry here, this may not give you much of a pullback. before going higher again, bitcoin could be looking at the 10, 12 000 range, just before settling down a little bit. so you don't want to be, you don't want to miss it here. personally, I would say, if you don't have a position, even 7 800, even though price is very likely to come back down. but you know well below that entry point, I think just having peace of mind of having a decent size position is not a bad strategy in my opinion. but certainly, if we get back down, I think if you zoom out a little bit this cluster here which obviously I thought was going to provide some solid resistance on the way up, and it did not. I do think it's going to be meaningful. this is a very watched, well watched area on the charts and on the pullback it wouldn't be too difficult. this is kind of kind of the area that you'd think would be given back, but anything sort of to 65, 64, 6500. if you're looking to get long again for that sort of hot oil position, don't hesitate. I would say that's more than more than plenty. you know, even though the kind of the downside potential in a cycle low would be this cluster here, this is where it broke out from and I wouldn't be surprised if that full move gets retraced in any move. so down to 5800 is also a possibility in the coming cycle. and then worst case, I would think, is these kind of bottoms here, which is like the half cycle low. this is at the half cycle point, at 50, at 5 000. so that's my absolute bottom at the moment. I did, like three, two or three weeks ago, think that we could test these cycle highs at some point at 4200. I don't really see that anymore, purely because of this extension here. so the further, higher and higher we go. the further we go, the you know the. obviously the pullback is going to be higher up at a certain point. so I think we're going to maybe target this half cycle low point or the tops right here. the breakout point or the most bullish would be just sort of pull back to this 6300 area. I'm not going to be looking for shorts. I may consider a short if we start to really break down, may try, and you know, and pull on the short here for this move here. but this is just too strong and you know I don't like trading counter to to a trend, especially a trend of this significance and strength, prefer to just leave my trading positions when not trading in BTC. so yes, I'm not, I'm getting. I will be exposed on a one-to-one basis to a decline like this because I don't want the market to run away from me and and be sitting in something like USET. one other strategy is to to not short this move but sit in USDT or you know some, some stable coin, so that way you're not riding, say you know, $1,000, move lower here and then buying or just transferring back your trading trading positions at around the 64 to 6,500 area back into BTC, then getting ready to leverage long at the next 60-day cycle low. when that comes at some point, more likely towards the end of May. that's another strategy that you could employ again. the problem with that is that if the market only pulls back slightly, forms another sort of shallow 60-day cycle low, maybe around day 58, day 62, something like that. so over the next week, let's say, that forms a cycle low around 7,000 and you don't get a chance and rallies back up and you don't get a chance to to sort of transfer that stable coin holding back into BTC. then it could be difficult to one get leverage and also just be exposed on a one-to-one basis to Bitcoin. so I like to, now that we have sort of a bull market- I'm not a bull market necessarily, but a new four-year cycle and certainly a significant uptrend in place, I want to be denominated for sure all the way in BTC and then pick my leverage long positions well on the dips as much as possible. so I'm focusing on this upcoming cycle low at some point. anything in the kind of 62 to 6400 area with a reversal and a swing is something I would want to buy. but ideally I'd like to see kind of a day 65 to day 68 cycle low down in this sort of 5,000, with a breakout point here around 5,700. that would be, I think, a kind of a nice setup for another long move at that point. so that's the Bitcoin wrap-up. let's go into now the top 10 alts or the the nine other top 10 alts that we have, and see what the markets are telling us. all right, starting with Ethereum here. so one recurring theme- I've gone through some of these charts already- recurring theme is that looks like we've made a bottom. we now have swings in place. we now have moves above declining trend lines. we now have close closing candles above the 10 and 20 day moving averages. so I think it's now time to start taking some positions. we have a good pullback this morning as well in most of these, because Bitcoin did move lower significantly and these also pulled back. so the one concern I have is Bitcoin into a cycle low. does it drag all of the coins lower further as well? so do do all the top 10 majors underperform as Bitcoin falls as well? that's the probably the threat that we, that we face right here if we do go long. but some of these do look very good and are pulling back. so I think we'll be looking at some long trades pretty much when I'm done with this video. the alerts may, even could, actually be out by time. this gets sort of you know, edited, uploaded, published that type of thing. but aetherium here has now, so it reversed, put a nice candle in yesterday and now it's popped above kind of the alert that I had set overnight- so I'll work up to this alert- had a good move up here, now it's pulling back, so this could be a good opportunity to buy. and then maybe the stop- well, the stop could always, always be down by the you know the lows. that's a significant way down and would require a very fairly small position to accommodate that much risk. so maybe the stop then would be something like here at the uh, so 27 000 level here, or the 0.027 level. um, that seems like a logical place, because reversing back down at that point and breaking below, back below what will be a rising 10 and 20 day moving average, is, uh, it's probably just too bearish for this and it would mean a failed chart pattern as well. so, looking at a theorem here, I think it'll be taking a trade very shortly once I'm done with this video. and then ethereum versus usd. all the usd ones have done really well um, but this one worries me: a dollar, I think if, if bitcoin is going to be falling against the dollar as well, then these won't do that well um against the dollar. so I think I want to trade it versus btc for now. but we still have a nice little pattern in play here: um, low, low, low, low come up here. so it looks like we could well maybe pull back to sort of this um prior cycle point here, um, and that could come over the next, you know, so two weeks, if we get that um, that bitcoin cycle low. so against the dollar. I'm not so bullish at the moment, even though this chart looks really good. um, both look good to be honest with you, against the dollar and against btc. so it looks like the, the alts may have, may have found bottom um and they were punished quite a bit over the last few weeks. so it's encouraging that ethereum, which is a driver, of course, for a lot of the, the tokens, that ethereum is doing well. so I'll be going long against btc, but I like this against the dollar as well. so ripple looks um, like it's pulling back here a little bit of a bearish kind of a bearish engulfing candle that's forming here. um, so I don't really like that, but it's still only back to the 10 day moving average. this is when I did go, long before I had that confirmation, and I did that for only one reason, and I think I think followers would know what that is, and that is that ripple has shown in the past that once it makes a move, it's very, very rapid and sudden, and I wanted to be a part of that if it was going to make another move like that. I think, see, here you've had this massive move like that. you have a couple more like that. so when it moves, it seems like it takes, it makes that move over just three to five trading days sometimes, or maybe, you know, a week or two at the most. and the second thing is it bounced right off this level here which I was focusing on, in fact almost the entire way down. this was the first kind of level here, but this one here was one I was really looking at. it seemed like it bounced right off that point and the first candle here was very significant back to the 10 day moving average. so I took the long. for that reason I'm still long with the short right at the lows here. so it's not a huge position because the potential is for a, you know, a good double or even triple. so I didn't need to take a very big position. and also because the candle is so big here, there's a decent amount of risk, percentage wise. you know it's over 20 or around 20 something percent. so with a 20 something percent risk on a trade, you know there's only so much you can take if you're only risking less than one percent of your overall capital. so this one I still, I still like, even though it's pulled back a bit today, back at the 10 day moving average, I think, if you didn't get in, I think this is probably a good spot because it's bouncing back on the well. it's back at the 10 day moving average, so that's, you know, that's something that provides a little more opportunity now and then your stop would be down there. but overall, you know, I think there's a downtrend that's in play that could be, looks like could be- negated, and if it is negated and the trends up, then the move could probably, you know, easily- I wouldn't say easily, but it could easy, it could, it could double from this point back up to this sort of 10,000 level up here, and even that is well, that's probably the top of the channel here that we had for most of 18 and 19. so it seems like it's done that in the past. if you can see right here, it's gone from the bottom to the top. it's gone here from well below kind of where it started here up to that level as well. so there's a lot of precedence there for for it to get back to sort of 10,000 level fairly quickly. so you don't need a huge position here. I guess, is my point. if it's going to double, then just just take enough away. if it does get stopped out here, it's not going to be, you know, it's not going to hurt you all that much. yeah, bitcoin cash- another example here of how the charts look really good against the dollar, but against btc they still have not made their move. so I think I think a lot of these against the dollar. if you've made those moves, if you traded against the dollar, then it's sort of profit taking time in my opinion, but against btc, a lot of them seem like they may just be only starting again, the caveat being or the concern being that, with bitcoin moving to a potential cycle low, that these will also suffer as a result. look at bitcoin cash versus bitcoin holding up pretty well. so I mean, I'm not a huge fan of this chart right now but in fact, if anything, at least it has more strength than say, ethereum did, because ethereum was kind of at the at the bottoms or the lows from december and this one has actually held those lows fairly well. so this here is an opportunity to to get long good, good candle that's reversed. unfortunately, maybe with across the 10-day moving average. this could be a long here and then the short- sorry, the- the stop is. you know it's fairly manageable at this point. so this here is a candidate. if you're like trading bitcoin cash, this is something that is a potential candidate right now for a continuation higher. yeah, eos looks like it's maybe found bottom as well, but has not given me the confirmation i'm looking for. i have an alert set on the trend line break, even though this is a fairly steep trend line here. let's try and move it like that. i think it's up there now. we had three good candles. again all these charts have three good candles. the question is, is it kind of a dead cat bounce at this point as bitcoin moves lower, or is it the start of a sort of altcoin rally? um, hard to say, hard to say here. i mean, we need more, probably a little more confirmation before getting too excited. i don't want to go long across the board in a lot of these i'm going to pick, you know, i've got ripple, probably ethereum coming up and maybe one or two more. don't want to get too heavy in here, but probably want to get some exposure in case, uh, we do move further. but eos is not one of them yet. at this point i think we need, i think i want to see a little more here and i want to see that 10 day really start to turn higher as well. um, still fairly pretty far away from across at this point and, uh, it's come down quite a bit, so there's plenty of room again. you know, don't no point in rushing these if the trend continues and getting in a higher point, but be with more on a more on a confirmed uptrend. it's going to be, um, you know it's going to be potential for a good sort of 30 to 50 percent move still. so no need to rush this. i want to see and make sure this is not just a three day- you know, three day wonder here before turning lower. litecoin is also similar. has not shown us confirmation yet back above the 10 day. a couple of candles here that were sort of somewhat, somewhat pulled back by the end of the day. looking for a trend line break, um, i've said this in the past: litecoin would be one of the leading candidates to get long. it has shown the most strength over the last six months. uh, with a december low as well. uh, so the trend is nice there. we want to see this resumption of that trend before getting in here. not enough evidence for me to be convinced that this is not just a little sort of dead cat bounce back to the 20 day moving average. we had one similar here. um, again, i want to see that breakout here like this: yeah, i want to see that breakout come back down and that that tells me there's a new trend in play. this at the moment is not telling me that, but again, constructive and, um, you know, potentially a new low here formed and a new uptrend to begin. but i want to see that confirmation. same theme, same story here with the binance coin seems like a little bit of a low nice bar. but again, not enough here. too much separation between the 10 and 20 day moving average: decent decline here. obviously they had the hack that, um, you know, sort of propelled or pushed this a little lower, maybe lower than uh than before. but clearly the uptrend that started from december um was negated and broke down. we saw that with the eventual break right here. but it was clear once the 10 and 20 day crossed right up here that that downtrend had begun. so there's no reason to necessary to to expect that the lows are in here, um, and again, with bitcoin coming up to a cycle low, we could still be seeing lower prices. so be patient on this one. i mean, i like this from a longer term standpoint, but a lot of, a lot of profit taking here, a lot of, a lot of rooms still left to the downside perhaps. so i don't want to to be longing this here until i see again evidence, and the evidence is not there just yet. the xlm is another one here. um, i just played around with the uh, the alert there, um, so this one here: deep, deep, deep lows. i don't like the chart. i don't like the weakness that it's showing, but it does have two big actually. it was at one point looks like three really big green candles, well above the 20 day moving average, over this sort of trend line, but it's reversed back quite a bit. uh, this is a huge flyer. um, a lot of volatility. don't like those types of moves, so i want to see this to establish an uptrend before trying to get long. there's so much upside room in something like this that, um, you know i'm not in any particular hurry to get long just for the sake of being early. um, you know, when something offers a lot of potential, profit potential and an uptrend, there's no point in trying to front run something like this when it's shown a tendency to disappoint- and this one has been disappointing now since november, when so many, so many of these charts are going upwards. this one's been going down almost the entire time. uh, if you look at it's just been a couple of weeks- maybe a week here and not even a week here- uh, of some, of some strength in the last six months. so i don't want to front run something like this and don't fall into the value trap again that, looking at 1400 satoshi, thinking it's cheap when it was at 4 000 not long ago. it's just a value trap for me. that's not um, that's not trading. yeah, ada is one that's looking a little interesting. um, it has reversed. it has gone back above the 10 day. it's as a 20, pulled back quite a bit of the overnight low. so we had a good, really fast move and all of them are showing this chart: uh, 20 almost, and now it's pulled back another 10 percent. yeah, this is again i i'm not the type of trader that wants to just rush in here and fomo into these moves. um, you know, again this shown that it can. it can double in price. so if a new uptrend is going to come, then this can easily double again or more. so i don't want to rush into this because this one doesn't have, like litecoin for example, a nice uptrend. it just has, um, this sort of inverted v, um, you know, mountain type pattern and a lot of weakness and and and downside here. so i don't have a whole lot of confidence trying to get ahead of it right now. i'm just going to wait and see. on this one um back above sort of 11.50 to 1200 here would get me excited again and that would sort of make me think that there's a an uptrend in play. but it's a little early still. don't rush it. and again, because bitcoin has that looming uh potential top and cycle lower head, this gets me a little worried. and also the way they reacted soon as bitcoin kind of dropped from 8300 overnight to 78 or 79 hundred in the last sort of hour or so, corresponding to this move, tells me that there is going to be some potential relative weakness in the top 10 versus bitcoin as bitcoin drops. so that's that's a sign that i want to be cautious. tron is showing some potential bottoming action again and again. same old um analysis here that we have for all the top 10 um. this one does have a big base that's come into. i did say you know many weeks ago that it looks like it's. it's looking or heading back into that base area still could have one more move, though again with bitcoin coming down, um could have one more move lower and then down to this area. i think if it gets down to this area here in the next week or two, that could correspond with bitcoin cycle low and also correspond with these three uh lows here back there. i think that would be an excellent buying opportunity on a reversal at that point. so looking forward to that. but now if in the short term, to get long, something like this, i still want to see this go above the 20-day moving average and get maybe even above sort of this 410 or 400 level before looking to to get long at that, at that point the 400, um 400 satoshi level it looks like then the the downtrend would be reversed, swing would be in place and then an uptrend could develop again from 400 up to the highs here only three months ago. is a double when you're looking at things that can double on you. i mean, you know, in any asset you trade in the world, you know looking at a double was unheard of unless you're talking about an intermediate term trade over maybe a year or two. so to look at short-term doubles and looking to to be positioned for those, what's the point in front running or getting in very early for an extra 20 percent or 10 percent when you can maybe get positions when you have solid confirmation and have a much lower chance of being stopped out or being wrong on the trend? so that's the way i'm approaching these here, similar to what i did kind of in february, with a lot of these charts, what waited for a lot of the breakouts to develop and then, you know, took profit. i think we'll do the same type of thing here as well, all right. lastly, look at the market cap. here, total market cap, excluding btc, up quite a bit: hit over the 100 billion dollar mark. this was a- i mean, this is clearly showing a bottom right here. there's, uh, plenty of beautiful evidence right here. um, looks like it wants to pull back this. here, though, the market cap is now a function of bitcoin's rally, even though this chart is excluding bitcoin. um, you know, these are denominated instead of in bitcoin. that's what the trading pairs are more are more common with, and this is showing the. this is really showing the strength in in bitcoin here, and as they're priced in bitcoin, um, bitcoin to dollar is up, so the market cap is up as well. um, so this looks pretty good at the moment. it's it's confirmation. let's get through this cycle low in bitcoin over the next week or so, and i think a lot of these alts are really going to take off and show some real gains, even against btc. okay, so that's the wrap up for today. leave any comments that you have. i hope you enjoyed the top 10 report. uh, tomorrow i'll come out with an alt cap. uh request any requests you have, please place them in the comment section and until then, happy trading.
