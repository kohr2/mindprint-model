Hello Bitcoin Live members it's Bob Lucas it is June 21st I hope you're doing really well this is your lightning report but as usual we cover Bitcoin first go over what we're seeing here and the move is of course spectacular nice big breakout kind of at that nine thousand dollar level here consolidated around the nine or two hundred dollar area now up to ninety eight hundred dollars really it's one move from the lows here around seventy five hundred up around two or so thousand dollars I got in on this break of a 10-day moving average around the 8350 area or so and then this candle was big confirmation of that move slight pause at that 8800 nine thousand dollar level and then it's been fairly much a move higher since then honestly you know it's just hard to tell with such a large or such a significant uptrend like this at some point it's going to reverse and reverse sharply and it's going to move lower but you know I just don't know when this ends and if you look at some of these other moves here they're three four thousand dollar moves or they're like 60 70 percent moves this could easily make a move to almost a twelve thousand dollar area in my opinion even a little slightly above that and just be part of a normal or part of at least the same type of structure that we've seen since the February lows it would fit that type of trend that we've seen and then move up to that point could indeed also consolidate more for for you know a few weeks like it did here and then go again or could be a intermediate level top I just don't know if there's any way you can time a top in this type of market it's just a matter of trusting the trend um not looking at how extended the market is at a longer term time frame and thinking well you know I don't want to get caught at the top and just riding the wave now I took some profit just this morning as you know from the alert purely because you know leverage market you know a 1500 dollar move is is big enough as you would know if you're trading leveraged instruments and the other reason is one to take profit and two to allow me now to be comfortable with long with big gains in a move and not have to sort of babysit the move over like a weekend or after hours I could put my stop at a reasonable point I've got it here actually I've got to switch to a four hour candle for you to see where or why I put my stop there and just get rid of the Bollinger Bands so I'm not sure why it's okay here we go so right sort of gave it some room below this candle here which is slightly above the breakout point I figure at this point getting below that 9400 area is kind of probably not confirmation but a good chance that this big move here has ended at that point so I'm giving it kind of enough room here now that I have some profit in the bank to you know to continue higher or to at least to gyrate a little bit in this area before going up so that's my reasoning or logic behind it it's not a science it's just arbitrary uh read of the candles as they progress in real time for me to find a spot where I believe the move is uh invalidated and no longer active but for now um I again like I said see the reason why I can't pop over 2000 start moving get some more FOMO going above the 10 000 level and make that move to 12 000 and it's just a matter of letting it go the big profits are made when you sit in your hands and you just basically wait in a position don't be scared um to lose some of the profit when there's a possibility with in a trending market like this to get a much bigger price that's where the real big profit comes in holding big winners for you know 40 50 60 gains you do that and then you get tight on the stop side when you're wrong and then in the long run you'll do well so that's kind of the uh the thinking okay I'm going to get into the lightning report now I only have two requests from members in the comments I'll go over those and then I'll just go over some chance that to see just just through my scan of the uh of the charts today first request I have is fetch fetch io I gotta be honest with you sorry I don't don't really like this chart um so you start off here on binance of course right and then all I really see here is just a number of step down tops and you get my point here just a series of lower highs all the way down lower lows to a large extent there was one slightly lower high here but that didn't follow through with another high here now it's trending lower maybe find some support at this level here coming off this cluster don't know um not a trade in my opinion and then you've got the all-time kind of lows in may not too long ago now not a lot of price history here of course but I think until you see some stabilization maybe a balance off this area here um you've got to assume that this is still on the downtrend so this is not a play as far as I'm concerned um don't fall into the value trap where you think okay well it listed at you know 1100 satoshi and now it's at uh um you know sorry 11 000 well and then now it's at 1800 um that it must be a value I didn't realize the size of that decline until I just uh took a look at that that's a massive decline just in three months there's no value in that I'm sorry I just wait wait for a um wait wait for a lower low maybe coming somewhere in this area and then a reversal then you want to see a couple of higher highs so depending on where the next high is maybe this level here the 3000 level being taken out on the upside for more confirmation that um you know there's maybe a bottom in place on something like this yeah this one is similar to a lot of the old coins out there it's just not doing well we it has a possibility that's looking at a double bottom here with uh these February lows but you know you zoom out and all you see is a big decline so um nothing for me to get too excited about here until it finds a low hopefully in this area if it makes a deeper low then you can't really trust this for a while you need to find uh another series of higher highs and higher lows if it does find support right here and begins to uh to move higher like this then the first step is to get over this little hump right here but you would really think getting over this level here would be important to establish a new trend again similar to the last one you've got a move down from sort of five six thousand level down to this 1500 level so why rush getting back in uh catching a bottom in markets like this is very hard to do and doesn't really pay off catching a market that you see a nice confirmed trend in does pay off and then you still have a double potential even if you get into the 2000 level and hold it to 4000 for example that's a double but trying to pick bottoms like this typically will mean you get stopped out and it's going to hurt you in a long run all right gonna try something very new here a very fast click through of a lot of charts very quick analysis i'm seeing most of these for the first time in a week or a month even so take it for what it's worth ada back down into this lower level nothing positive about something like this um um coming to avoid in my opinion agi new lows avoid aik new lows avoid ast down near the bottom avoid adam no comment not enough history bat more constructive but still seeking a low maybe in this area here find some support for now it's just a wait and see btt in a decline needs to find a new high up to at least 17 18 before this turns otherwise this is heading back to the nine area or 10. seller nothing there needs to make another high it needs to hold this area here on the bottom the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom

possibly find some support and go higher not encouraged overall ETC heading back down EOS. Factum. Factum. New lows. Go BTC. New lows. Grin. Maybe maybe one of the positive ones here looks like a um a double low here that that didn't form that formed higher higher high nice bar there to to exceed that this is actually nice this here could be a buy the dip right here with the 10 day moving average so grin is one that looks positive not good hot maholo looks like it's going lower self key lower link well links not too bad this one's had a lot of uh a lot of attention but you gotta respect the trend uh see if you can find a low here somewhere in this area and then evidence of a move back up could be bought perhaps LTC so LTC I got out because I didn't want to keep seeing my profits disappear and now the 10 day moving average has completely turned over so far looking like a good deal or a good move at least mana coin looks like it's going to make new lows not good Matic I think this is breaking down Qtum breaking down Raven coin looks like it's breaking down all these charts where I hope they can find a low that's not happening strat breaking down new lows geez these are these are not positive charts VET I went over VET a second ago Vertcoin had a nice move didn't follow through broke down support now it's at new lows not good Ripple breaking down I got out for a reason Zek Decent actually Decent looks like a new uptrend could possibly be bought using one of these short-term lows as a stopping point now especially back at the 10 day moving average Zek is a potential long Zill back to the lows could possibly be bought I wouldn't buy it near the lows and it's acting like the rest of the market is so I avoid this one ZRX back at lows not good so I get I think you get the point here that's four minutes showing you around 10 or 15 charts they all look fairly horrible I think Grin was about the only one Zek wasn't too bad I think there's one other one in there as well anyway that's the update for today lining report look I've said this before alts do not look good have not looked good for three months it's the reason why I'm not trading these I don't want to participate and trade assets that are in declines I want to buy them when they're looking good and don't fall into the value trap of thinking that they're cheap so you want to buy them doesn't work all the best have a great weekend and see you on Monday and see you on Monday and see you on Monday and see you on Monday and see you on Monday and see you on Monday and see you on Monday and see you on Monday! and see you on Monday!
