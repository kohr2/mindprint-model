Hello Fintat members. it's Bob Lucas. It is June 30th here in New York. I hope you're doing really well. This is your weekly update, covering to begin with gold, and I think most of the report will focus on gold. to be honest with you, This is where the action is right now and this is where my most of my excitement is for the time being, Obviously for the reason you see on the screen right here. we have a really significant rally that seems to be cooling off a little bit now in gold. I think it should cool off, although I wouldn't be surprised, to be honest with you, if you just kept going. But for now, the way I see this is that we have a day 24 top in the first daily cycle. We did have a beautiful consolidation here over three full cycles- or two and a half cycles, I should say, because we did have this shortened day 13 cycle before the rally. This here is commonplace in surprise rallies where we get a short cycle to end, but the investor cycle in general that just ended recently was a particularly long cycle and I think this consolidation here over many, many weeks that went down only, I think, around about 80 dollars in price in the end has been very bullish for gold and we've seen this massive launch higher. Now day 24 looks like we should have a top. It could go again, though. The first daily cycle in a major run can go as high as day 32, day 33 before seeing a top. So do not be surprised if the market opens tonight and tomorrow with a nice rally higher and then off to new highs. It could happen, especially when you have this type of recent trend. that's in place. but I would prefer- and we should probably expect- a more likely scenario where we'll have a few more days lower. Let's see if we can get back down below the 10 day moving average, but stay above the 20 day moving average. There isn't much separation between the two, about 20 or 30 dollars- and in that case by Wednesday or Thursday we should have a 20 day moving average back up above, above 1380 or so, So somewhere between 1400 and 1380.. So around about 20 dollar decline from here would be a perfect first day, first daily cycle low in a what's possibly a- let's call it- a short-term parabolic run, or at least a breakout from a major sort of foundation that's been built in gold over the last six years, and I'll cover that in the weekly chart, But this chart here overall, I love the gold action. This is the type of action that I've been talking about for quite a while that we could be seeing upcoming and I think with the confirmation or the move above sort of the 1370- 1380 area, which the gold is confirming that it wants to go higher, and in this area there isn't a whole lot of resistance, and I'll show you again that on the weekly chart and also on a monthly chart further down in the report, I don't think there's a whole lot of resistance in this area. to be honest with you, We got down below this area fairly quickly from the 2011 highs, certainly above 1500. there isn't too much resistance. but you also have to remember that last time gold was in this area, it was six years ago. so whatever price or chart sort of whatever price we can relate back to that area, I think is almost irrelevant at this point. I mean, obviously, invest hands. gold hands have changed multiple times since then, so I don't put too much weight into where gold traded on the way down six years, six to seven years ago. so I think this is why we have a lot of open air above us here and, I think, a lot more room to move. so let's move over to the next chart. I think miners were a little slow out of the gate but have now caught up as well. they have made new highs for the investor cycle. they have broken out also above sort of that multi-year level, taking out a considerable amount of past investor cycle highs. so I think gold is definitely- I mean sorry, the miners are definitely confirming this move. this is very positive. typically, actually, I have I've seen that during major sort of recognition moves in gold, meaning major kind of cyclical changes in trend, like we're seeing right now. sometimes the miners do lag, like silver does, but not the case right here. the weekly RSI obviously is pegged near the top, showing us a lot of strength right here, but the candle here could also be indicating that we need to take a breather. this week we've had five, five white candles higher up from the twenty dollar area, so it's up around about over twenty percent. nothing crazy, though, for for the miners when they get going they can really move, and twenty percent for gdx is is is good, but it's nothing, uh, what I would call outrageously a radiusly speculative or anything like that, but again. I think a pullback just for one week as gold comes into the first daily cycle would be appropriate. it would refuel the move. but I think the miners here have the ability to do the same type of move again in the next coming second daily cycle. so another 25 move which would bring gdx up above 30 dollars in the next cycle. it's possible for sure that they could do that. nothing wrong with the silver chart as well, even though it is definitely lagging gold and the miners. I've looked, I've gone back to some of the other moves in the year 2000 for example, and before that, when gold made major upside moves and silver definitely lagged and then caught up significantly after that. so I think silver is going to have a great run, but it may not be into the next investor cycle. but either way, if gold continues higher, silver will certainly at least probably match from a percentage standpoint. it won't outperform like it normally does, but I think it should still be able to sort of keep track and keep pace with um, you know, with what gold is doing, although at the moment here it's really only up around 10 percent, which actually I think probably is equivalent to what gold is up, but we're just so accustomed to seeing silver do sort of double the performance on the way up and double the uh the negative performance on the way down. but looking at this chart here, the previous investor cycle highs are up in the 16: 20 area. I would expect that in the next daily cycle we would get back up to that level, maybe even more. I know a 10 percent move from here gets us up to around about 16: 70. so I think we should probably bounce off this 10 day moving average, maybe slightly break below, especially if gold drops for two or three days. so drop below, hit this sort of trend line that's uh developing here, using some of the half cycle low candles, come up and then just rally pretty steeply at this point and also make a move above the 16- 20 area, maybe 16- 80, like I said, for a 10 percent move, and that would put silver well on its way then to a possible longer term trend change and reversal. and and then from there in the next cycle I think silver would start to catch more and more of a bid, especially when you look at the cot report, which I'll get into shortly, the cot report and silver looks very healthy. this looks like there's a lot of room for speculators to come in, as opposed to gold where it's significantly stacked in the favor of speculative long. we don't see that in silver. so I think silver will eventually catch its bid and, like I said before, catch up to gold's performance. all right. so one thing a lot of people are concerned about is the cot report, commitment commitment of traders report- and it is a little worrisome because we have near record speculative long positions and we know speculators uh typically pile in. they're kind of the dumb money right, they just chase the gains and they're at records right now and you can see it here in the chart: um in um in the large specs here on the top, a huge amount of large specs, um. also, from a net standpoint, very few shorts. so the net is very high. and then the commercials here as well are not uh well, actually they increase their long position slightly but they're also quite significantly short. so this type of thing is generally what you see at the top for the investor cycle and then you generally see a reversal at some point soon, a pretty sharp one, because you've got such a significant amount of long position that needs to be sold when the market begins to decline and there's certainly no short covering as well. so this is the one concern. however, um, i've i've been looking at the bleeds rating, which is a rating from zero to 100 zero indicating excessive bullish speculators positions. that is normally seen around the top and then the hundred level is when everybody's pessimistic and short, and then you see that around the bottom or a low. so right now we are seeing the first zero in the bleeds rating, uh, indicating again, as we see on this chart, a significant amount of long positions here. so that's not good. but a zero rating, uh in the bleeds rating also doesn't come up very often. it doesn't get that extreme that often what it does. looking back over the last 10 years- i'm going to see if i can bring up a chart for that- so in the last 10 years it came up, uh, i think four times. the last time it came up was um. besides now, of course, was during this um bear market low in 2015 and then the rally in 2016.. this rally here in 2016 was around about a 40, 30 to 45, 35 percent move, i think it was, and the the zero bleach rating showed up right here after this big candle here and then it went on for- and these are weekly bars- it went on for like an hour, 12 weeks, before the the bleach rating really started to move higher again. so it was at zero for something like six or seven weeks, and it bounced back and forth between zero and ten. but the market, though, continued to rally. even though we had this sharp decline right here into a cycle low, it still continued to rally from kind of where it showed up in this 1200 area all the way up to the 1370 area. we did also see zero come up somewhere, and actually i don't have it marked on the chart. it might have been right here during the bear market came up for one week, and then it reversed, so that was a negative signal. it did actually indicate a top, but then another time it came up was right here during this move to the top in 2011.. this was the actual bull market move, the final parabolic move, and it rallied for around about six weeks after the zero came up and rallied sharply. and then another time that it came up was out of this beautiful pattern here, out of the financial crisis, where it sort of consolidated here, formed a neckline, and then i'm not sure exactly where it appeared, but i think it didn't top for around about six or seven weeks from the appearance of the of the zero, and if you look at this chart, really it's the rally stars in the bottom here, but i think the zero came up right near the breakout of this neckline. so my point is that, even though um, this type of speculative profile is not good and we've seen tops occur relatively quickly, when it comes up on the flip side, when it gets too extreme, like we're seeing right now, and it's accompanied with price action that is similar to this. let's move over here. sorry, my machine's running a little slow today, okay. so when you see with price action similar to this, at least in the three out of four cases it was associated with major moves: the major move out of the financial crisis. major move out of the bull market, the the bull market. the last major move in the bull market. top. the move out of the bear market- low. three out of the four were major moves and we're seeing another zero bleats rating right here on extreme. so i have a this suspicion right here that we are going to see something much more out of this before it tops, even though this is a, you know, pretty vertical type move. what if it's just the initial part of a move like that? or what was what i showed you earlier? i get the feeling that's what we're in right here and that's a bit of a, a bit of a leap of faith for me to make that statement. so, um, you know, bear with me with that, but just looking at the way this market's behaving, the reason and and also because we have broken out um out of this six year resistance area here it is now on a different weekly chart, um, we've broken out of significant resistance and we've broken sharply higher with, again, with that zero bleach rating. we're still early in the investor cycle. that that count is very clean and clear. so we're only on: uh, where is it week five or week six right here? um, i have a feeling now that we could rally for 150, 200 from this month point and um do that in very short order. now, that's somewhat of a guess. i agree, i'm not telling you to go out and and and put you know, bet so much on a 200 move, because it would be an outlier, but i'm kind of thinking and the way, the way i'm looking at this, is that we're looking at another outlier type of development that's occurring here. so this is a monthly chart and this is what i think could be happening here. i think we may be entering into a new bull market phase here, that one that we haven't seen since the 2011 top um again going out a little bit on a limb here in in making that statement. but look at this monthly candle that is about to close. um actually has closed. i should say that is a very powerful monthly looking candle. we have a beautiful, beautiful sort of symmetrical base here. uh, we have the nice bear market trend down. we had that beautiful uh 2016 rally, which is more of that initial recognition rally coming out of the bear market. we've had the accumulation phase now below this level, and now i think we have kind of more of the awareness phase in the next cycle. here we're out of the accumulation. i think we've accumulated enough, probably not enough supply to um coming in the market to keep the price down and we're seeing this upside explosion. this is why i think we can see a very rapid move now up to, say, 15- sorry, 1600, even, you know, 200- move from this point, um in a new bull market and then we can retrace, maybe come all the way back down to test this breakout point. that's also possible, um, but the bleach rating, uh, the way it's broken out from here, all of this is very positive to me. i did say many times when we were in this area last year and earlier this year that once we break out above this point, there probably isn't a whole lot of resistance now to fill the gap to the all-time highs around 1900. as you can see from here, we did have some support initially when the market peaked for about a year at this, i think, if i recall correctly, it's around about the 1500- 1520 level, so we may get a top at that area there. but again, i don't think those two see the bottom of those two candles there. i don't think they're applicable because they occurred in 2011 and the market's changed. it's a whole different cycle, so i don't think they'll play any type of role, whereas this here was significant resistance as as it was part of the, the bear market and also the accumulation phase of where we stand. so i think that again i'm repeating myself a little bit right now. just to summarize, i think we are done with- obviously done with- the bear mark. i've called that for a while now. i think we're done with kind of this accumulation phase. i think we're going to begin to climb our way back now for the remainder of this year, maybe into next year, up to the 1900 area, probably form sort of a handle pattern here and make this sort of one big cup- and i've shown you that chart quite a few times over the years, actually, and it's developing nicely. but i think we've formed the top of the cup, we've formed the handle and then obviously probably getting a little ahead of ourselves right here, but somewhere like in 2021, 2022, really break out into the 2000s and plus, and then that's we can make another move up towards maybe even 3000 and beyond, of course, talking out another sort of six to eight to maybe even 10 years from that point forward. for now, though, this is only encouraging. this is exciting news. i think we want to make sure that we have our good positions in place and overall now, what this means is that we can probably shift our bias from what was bearish last few years to more new tool in the last sort of 12 months and now probably more of a bullish stance. so we're looking for more bullish opportunities. we're trusting or expecting that we're going to get more upside surprises, as opposed to all the downside surprises that we were used to over the years, and i think for many of you that have been members since kind of 2011 and have been with me for the eight or nine years, i think this is great. this is kind of the type of action, at least the type of charts, that we've been looking for for for many, many years. so, um, let's, let's be positioned, let's get ready for, get ready for, potentially, what this can bring us and to take advantage of it. all right, let's uh move on now to the stock market. all right, gotta be honest here. i'm not going to spend too much time on the equity market and a little bit on crude. the reason for the equity market is because my cycle counts are not perfect and, uh, i've got it wrong a little bit recently. so whenever that happens, i like to take a step back and say: well, you know i'm not 100 sure. so if i'm not 100 sure, why the hell would i want to risk too much capital? i'm not being 100 sure. what i do know now- know what i do now believe i should say- is that we probably did have a 58 day cycle, although i'm seeing it more in the indicators, certainly in the macd, um, the um, uh, dch and dch price indicator here for the cycle. um, more likely is, uh, something associated with a 58 day low. uh, this low here kind of fooled me a little bit because it was perfectly in the timing band. we had a decent bounce. um, so i think this is the second daily cycle low. we made new highs as well, so that's also more of a confirmation that we have this cycle loan play. but what i don't know here now is that i mean, this investor cycle was pretty extended. if this is the third daily cycle, then you would think even another move up would turn lower right. um, yes, that's what you would think. but what if this also was just a two daily cycle icl? it was long enough and i'm going to switch to a weekly. here's the weekly. i mean this also is similar to the daily in that it does have enough evidence here to show that we probably have a cycle low. um, nice, big, big white candle here. we had the lows come in. we've now gone to make new highs, which means this week 19 top cannot be true if it's still part of the one cycle that started in december. if it's the same cycle, then we're already up to sort of week 26 making new highs. so overall, yes, we did have some long cycles previously, so there's no reason why we couldn't be on week 26. but the way we dropped below the 10-week moving average here indicated that that was a start of a decline, so declining phase of a cycle, which suggests to me that once it recaptured the the 10-week moving average and made new highs, that this is now an old cycle. so i do think we're on week three or week sorry, week four of this investor cycle. if that's the case, we have to also argue or believe that we're going on to make really big new all-time highs in the stock market. if you look at the chart going back a couple of years, you have a number of investor cycles below kind of this 2900 area looks like about 18 months to 20 months of consolidation, and whenever the equity market has done that over the last 10 years, it's then gone on to go on for another sort of two years rallying very sharply, and i think it's positioned now for that. i was a little bearish in this area, of course, but, uh, there is no reason to to be bearish right now based on these types of candles. now, anything below this candle right here, uh, is probably very bearish. anything below the 10-week moving average on a closing basis is probably bearish, because if we are on week four of the cycle, then closing below 10-week moving average would not be, um, not be something you'd expect now. you did see it a couple times here, for example, but this one didn't go too far. but a couple of candles below certainly would not be good. um, if it does get below that, then there's two assumptions, right, that one, you've got a week four top, or week five top, and that's not good. or this 24-week cycle low is not correct and it's still 27, 28 weeks, which means then that we're still heading lower. right, because the icl would be down this area and below this, this marker here. so, either way, we really want to see upside, upside from here, make new all-time highs, comfortably, also on a closing basis, and then just don't look back for a while. so right now i'm kind of looking more for long opportunities, definitely no shorting opportunities at the moment with this market, a little bit of a similar profile that, uh, that i showed you here in the equity market. but i think crude is showing it cleaner. so we definitely have a daily cycle low right here. we actually have three daily cycles that look nice and clean and then the type of strength that we're seeing here. the way it's blasted through the 10-day moving average has touched the top of the bollinger bands. it's gone into the 70s on the rsi 7. um to me looks like a first daily cycle. this is not the way a final daily cycle would behave, especially when you look at sort of a day nine high here and a failed cycle. this is just too strong, too powerful for this to be, in my opinion. uh, a fourth daily cycle in the investor cycle. so if this is a first daily cycle, it also um helps the the argument of that the equity markets in their first daily cycle as well. and then looking at crude at the weekly level- kind of similar thing- already back towards, or it was above the 10-week moving average for a little bit there. it's no longer, but it's still showing some strength. a little early here. the chart still needs a little more development for confirmation. but uh, we know crude right when crude is in decline towards the uh latter part of an investor cycle, it doesn't typically bounce back this sharply or this much, not over a couple of weeks, which again tells me, like the equity market, week 24 might be it for the investor cycle and if that's the case we should bounce up and we probably could even exceed the week 17 high we had here because we did stay well above the previous uh low. so it looks like now we could be starting a new uptrend for crude, especially if the equity market wants to break out and make some really big new all-time highs over a number of months, then you would think the uh, the crude crude oil, would get back above the 65 level and start to challenge some of these upper sort of 70 areas again as well. all right, so i think overall there's reason to be positive here for crude. um, just looking at this chart and look at the cycle count, well, i'm still amazed at how well the uh, the dollar, has moved towards or has tracked. you know your typical sort of cycle outlook. um, these have been so perfect to read and it's amazing. i should be trading the dollar um the dollar index futures, but i don't actually believe it, or not? uh uses more as my guide. but, uh, it would have been absolutely amazing to trade those futures. but looking at this here, we, um, we definitely have, uh, we're definitely close, i should say, to the next cycle. low looks to me like we're gonna maybe come down one more time to finish off this cycle or the cycle i may already be in right here, maybe get one good one or two days higher up into this 96 area and then maybe even turn lower. and i'll show you the weekly chart which does support some more downside. so the weekly is interesting because, yes, we could be looking at an icl right here, but we have broken down out of this pretty well defined kind of rising wedge and i think that is bearish, even though i'm not a massive fan of these types of patterns. but, um, we could also be looking at a three-year cycle top right here. so we could be, we could be looking at the may of the start of a pretty significant top for the dollar um, especially as maybe the fed begins to to really start to tighten rates now at this point and bring them back in um. that could really bring the dollar down um. also for this investor cycle, we we are on week 23 or 24.. i think if we have one more daily cycle, it wouldn't- um, you know, it wouldn't be out of the ordinary here. it wouldn't be unusual at all, and if we have started this trend, that would be a good way to show it. with one more failed daily cycle that gets us all the way down to maybe the 94 area. so over maybe three to four more weeks, we're not that oversold. i think there's plenty of room left to come lower for the dollar and it looks like it has started to to break down. these types of declines into. the last two icls were very orderly. we're coming from a higher point and we're already all the way back down here to the lower bollinger bands. this has more of a sort of- it's called a sharper decline or more of a panic feeling to it, and for that reason i kind of just get the feeling that we may be looking at one more cycle lower as well, and not that i think gold needs the dollar right here to rally. i think gold is kind of in its own space right at this point. but certainly it doesn't hurt to have the dollar at least soft or falling, when you know when gold wants to rally, rally like that. so for that reason again, i think we could be looking at one more cycle lower for the dollar. i'm going to leave you with some quick analysis here on bitcoin. so bitcoin has obviously had a phenomenal run for, for those of you who are not aware, it's up a couple hundred percent. in the last three months. we've seen three cycles higher, each higher, each cycle up around about sort of 60 to 70 percent. had this area here where it already began back in march and then rallied up in april up to a top here in may around the 8 000, came back down, formed a very sort of shallow cycle low, consolidated. we've seen periods of consolidation and rally, consolidation and rally, consolidation and rally. right now what i believe is we have a day 39 top. we're on day 43, only sort of seven days out from the early timing band for the next cycle low and all the way out to maybe 17 to 20 days for the for the typical cycle low. so i think we have a cycle low due coming up. i think one of two things are one, this para parabolic like move out of the three thousand four hundred, all lows could be over and we're looking at something like a 30 to 40 percent correction in price. that would be expected, based on the fact that we're up 180 of the three thousand four hundred dollar levels. but that would only bring the market down. well, not only it's significant, of course, but let's just say 35 percent down to kind of this. uh, well, does that seem right? yeah, down to, let's say, the nine thousand dollar level, at 35, at a 40 correction. then we're talking about uh 8 300 level, which you know is levels that we only saw around 20 and 30 trading days ago. so in the end, a 40 decline will seem absolutely severe. but when you compare it to action, it's only uh action that we actually saw beginning of this month. if you look back here, this is june. so on, uh, on june the first, it was trading at 8 300. so we'd only be bring it back pretty much to where the cycle began. um, and that's that's perfectly fine in the bull market, especially when you zoom back out and look at where price was here just in the beginning of the year. this would be a healthy retracement. but i think something else might be going on here. i think we are looking at this parabolic move that has not ended, that actually wants to go and test all-time highs. all-time highs are only at 20 000, which i say only um, of course. we look at gold and it moves a hundred dollars and we, we go crazy, this, this thing moves, uh, you know, a thousand dollars in a day sometimes and, uh, it's just a whole different market. but right here i think we could be looking at another consolidation like this, some type of um, you know, standard consolidation- whether it's a pennant or a flag, whatever the case may be- but something that grinds in here- maybe it goes out a little more like this- forms a cycle low via sideways price action. let's remove this 40 right here and let's go with price from the breakout point. these other moves here we're around about 50 and 60 percent each one of these. so if we go from here and we kind of go up to this- uh, you know so, 60 percent range, then we start to get to the 19 000 range and that's where the market topped out in 2017.. now, hopefully it'll show- it's a little tight on my screen. i'm doing this on a laptop, but you can see right here. this is definitely sort of parabolic in nature, but we've seen kind of this: one, two, three steps up and we're up to sort of 13 000 here in a few months. i don't see a reason why, if it's gone like that, i don't see a reason why it doesn't go up and maybe test those all-time highs. so i think that's what the market might be telling us. but again, watch out for this, because i think we have top for the short term. i think for it to make a run up towards that area, we need to form a cycle low first and ideally, and also based on the pattern of relate, the way it's been making cycle lows- i think it's going to do that via consolidation. if this starts breaking down over the next few days and maybe gets below the candle from- i think it was thursday- the lows there are 10 300.. i think if it gets below 10 300 right there, then we could be looking at the correction scenario i talked about, because at that point now you're really starting to break down. you've got some real separation with a 10-day moving average. looks like you want to come back down at this point and there's so much room lower. once the market begins to lose support, then the floor will probably come out. there'll be a lot of profit taking as well. look at the bollinger bands. here the bollinger bands are all the way down at the seven thousand dollar level, so there is plenty of room and you would think that if the decline begins, there'll be a lot of selling here. so watch out for that. but again, while the trend remains up and the strength is there, we have to respect that and i think we could be looking at this move up to the 30, the 20 000 range. okay, so that's your weekly report. sorry, it came out late here on the sunday for you. uh, it does take a while to record and then edit and, uh, save and then upload and so forth, so i do apologize for you getting this late, but, um, have a great week. we'll be out with a midweek update. i'm going to see what i'm going to do about the next report. obviously, thursday here in the us is a holiday- july the 4th. there'll be no trading on july the 4th. i think friday is only a half day, so i think what i might do is try and come out with a report on wednesday evening, maybe in video format only, and that will cover the weekend as well. okay, so look out for that. until then, happy trading and all the best.
