Hey, good morning Bitcoin Live members. Bob Lucas, again Friday morning lightning report update. This is the report where I cover all the micro cap coins that you've requested from Wednesday's report in the comments section. There's around about 13 to 15 in there. I'm going to take probably around about 11 or 12 of them right now. I have a list I've made for myself and of course, I'll also cover Bitcoin. The caveat here, as it is every week, is that I mostly cover Bitcoin in the cycles, The altcoins. I'm looking at charts for the first time or since last week and you know it's pretty much a quick glance and giving you my overall opinion and analysis. But again, I'm not so much of a classical charting trader. I do use, you know, support lines and triangles etc. but they're not my primary method. Of course, cycles is what I use first and cycles are not necessarily applicable to the altcoin. So that's just sort of the disclaimer or the caveat I have here. And also, if I do see any other coins from my list that give me or have interest as far as I'm concerned, I will cover them today as well. Okay, so let's get stuck into it. As always, we begin with Bitcoin and we have a beautiful $300 move or more in Bitcoin. actually about $400 move overnight to new highs for the cycle, new highs for 2019.. What more can you ask for? That's great, right. I mean, anytime you have new highs, it's a good thing, It's an uptrend, it's positive, it's bullish. You can be as bearish as you want to be overall, but nothing tells me that we have strength in a market like new highs. So where does it leave us? Well, it means that the day 30 high that was marked here with a question mark- and that's the reason why it was a question mark- was because we didn't know if we'll get a further high in this cycle, and we do So. the head and shoulders top is off the table. the 30-day high is off the table and now we are already looking at a worst case of a day 39 high. if, for example, today ended up being the high, I don't think it will. to be honest with you, I think we still have more strength. We have a nice pattern of higher highs and higher lows being established. If you zoom in here, you'll kind of see that here. so we had this surprise early cycle rally breakout: higher made a first high here. a low, a high, a low and a high. That sequence is a nice, beautiful uptrend, telling us that we have a classic right translated 60-day cycle still in play. and whenever you see right translated cycles, it means an uptrend. it means the market's bullish. The previous two cycles, even though we had higher lows- they were not right translated, surprisingly- the tops occurred early in the cycle, but we had so much accumulation in the cycle, so much buying support, even though there was a lot of selling pressure. there were way too many buyers in the market and you can see this clearly since the December low. tops occur early, but buying support is there and it's been pushing the market higher ever since. so I've been saying this from the beginning: get your position investors, get invested, stay invested, because the market can surprise and will surprise. That being said, I do think in the short term, eventually we're going to run out of steam here because we are zooming out even more. We are going to pop up and we are now starting to hit up against this, this area here, which I think will start to provide some significant resistance. It hasn't just yet. in fact, it seems like people are more short or shorting this market, still still negative on this market, and I think that's creating the fuel to provide some short covering rallies, especially this last one here. there were just way too many shorts in the market and that's fueled the market, but I think people are going to start to turn pretty bullish right now. So we probably will get a pullback. then we may even get a more significant move up to maybe 6,000, 60, 200. that will get the bulls super excited. then we can probably place our top on the market here and that would be around about maybe a day 45 high, day 50 high, hard to say, but a nice, significantly right translated cycle, meaning then that we have a shorter period of time theoretically for the declining portion of the 60 day cycle, and then that means we most likely should hold above the two prior daily cycle tops at around about the 4200 area. so even even then, the $2,000 drop here would be really scary. pull a lot of the bulls out and then we can go higher again. All right. so that's what I'm looking at for here. if you took kind of my alert, it wasn't necessarily a trade alert to go long, but it was pretty much saying that it looks like the market wants to go higher and bitcoin wants to go higher. I think now it's kind of time to take some profit. it's going to pull back. I wouldn't get out completely. I would use the 10 day moving average as your guide for getting out completely from from that move. overall, I mean, the technical still look pretty good. yes, we are overbought, short term, due a pullback or due at least a consolidation over a day or two, but overall this still looks pretty good. you don't want to be fighting a trend. you don't want to be fighting a market that's in a nice move like this and this is a nice move higher and it could surprise to the upside. it could go to 62, 63, it could even go to 6500. I don't know. I always respect an uptrend and this is a nice beautiful uptrend since December and it seems like that uptrend is beginning, if anything, to accelerate even more. okay, that's the analysis for bitcoin. heading into the lightning report now, and the first one here is covesting. this was a request from a member. they requested it last week and I screwed it up and I put in cover, not cove, so I apologize for that, but this chart doesn't look too bad. we have more of a march as opposed to a December or February low, but we do seem to have the makings of a sort of around the bottom here, doing fairly well relative to bitcoin, considering bitcoin has been rallying. so that's a good sign. most of the alts are not showing that, but I probably would want to. if you are long, I think you stay long. you're probably now you know you have a nice floor here with recent lows. you can stay long up to that point. trading wise. it's probably too late now. you want to kind of maybe wait for that break. so here's the high on April the 18th. you have a couple of weeks above that, but something like that, getting above that can get you long and then you can use something like a more recent low, probably in this area right here, using all those candles around April 22nd to 26, as your possible stop point as well, maybe even tighter. you can get more aggressive with, say, the you know, 20 day moving average perhaps. but overall this is not a bad looking chart and looks like it wants to begin to make a run higher ztx here. so we ctx is one of those ones where we had December low and trend sideways for three months and now broken sharply higher. bit of a mess here. uh, pretty hard to trade this with a lot of leverage, a lot of big moves here. but overall what I notice is that the trend is up and when the trend is up you want to be playing with that move, um, but again, you know, you kind of have to go a little bit smaller size with something like this because of these, uh, these massive swings, that's going to be hard to take a position and, uh, and give it enough room for this to be able to swing so widely. but now it is kind of closer to the lower Bollinger Bands so it is possibly, um, you know, a long candidate. I don't see a trade necessarily, but I think if you, uh, you know, kind of invested this for the longer intermediate to longer term, then this is a good spot to get in. this is a good spot to to sort of get that position. you kind of want to look at maybe this area down here, um, that would be well below the Bollinger Bands if it did break down lower. so that's kind of a way to get out and using the bottom of this wick here as sort of a stopping point. so, again, not much of a trading um standpoint. I mean trade rep, the trade would have been back here if you were following something like this, because you had this, um, you know, you had this sort of wide, uh, big base and then you had a huge breakout. so, kind of like, getting out of this point here would have been. you know, using these points would have been the spot. right now it's just swinging wildly, looks like it wants to continue higher. so I like it long term, don't like much from a short term. trade standpoint. IOST, I know nothing about this, looking at this for the first time and overall. so overall, let's just assume and draw a line right through that these kind of like a mean right, so it's going up, it's an uptrend, um, but this here tells me that it broke the uptrend to the upside, became somewhat. so it's going to be a little bit more so it's going to be a little bit more so it's going to be a little bit more so. it's going to be a little bit more so. it's going to be a little bit more so. it's going to be a little bit more so. it's going to be a little bit more so it's going to be a little bit more so it's going to be a little bit more so it's going to be a little bit more so. it's going to be a little bit more so. it's going to be a little bit more so. it's going to be a little bit more so. it's going to be a little bit more So. I'm looking at this cluster right here. so I'm looking at- I'm just showing you- a long-term perspective. right, you're back in this sort of zone here which looks like we'll probably have enough support. so going all the way back to the January highs, back here to the February lows. so this here is a good spot. declined for quite a bit at this point. but you also want to look for a swing. you want to look for clear evidence that's making a move higher again before committing any real significant capital capital, because it is now in this downtrend. so maybe something like this: come back up and then boom, that's where you'd want to kind of get back in when it gets back above a 10-day moving average and the 20-day moving average which would be at that point sort of down in this area. and then you want to see a swing making a higher high on a shorter time frame and then you can get back long and then hopefully it's going to continue that uptrend recapture kind of that mean that I drew in here right and continue the trajectory. so this is like a pendulum swing. you've got a situation where nice uptrend goes too much to the upside and now it's going to go back to the extreme on the downside, hopefully recover and start to get back onto that longer term trend line. mco cryptocom, I guess by the looks of it. again, I don't know much about this one, but what I do see is a uptrend developing and we have December lows, February kind of double bottom confirmation. so let's just draw that in. this. one's actually a nice, nicely constructed chart, to be honest with you. so kind of have you know, you kind of have this sort of cluster in here and I'm just free drawing right now. so excuse me, it's not supposed to be 100 accurate, but here's kind of like your bottoming pattern, September didn't drop much lower than the September low, nice big base sort of here. now coming out of that base, a lot of accumulation trending higher. let's look at some arrows here. so you've kind of got your right. you've got a low here. you've got another low, got another low, maybe number low here. what do you notice there? yeah, you're noticing higher lows. then you've kind of got this. let's just say this: that's pretty clear. so this is pretty good. so let's look for a swing here. take a, take a position above, like you know, back above the 10-day moving average, then you can use whatever low is formed. so let's just say this candle right here: today is the low or tomorrow's the low, then you would draw in kind of that as your low. you would wait for a swing, wait for a recapture, the 10-day moving average or even 20-day moving average, wait for it to re-establish itself, get in and then use that as your stop and then you're basing it. you're basing the trade on a lower low, making a higher- sorry, a higher- low and then making a higher high at that point. so continuing this nice zigzagging uptrend that you see here. so this is a good looking chart. thanks for pointing it out and, you know, good luck with it. decreed. i know a lot of people love this project kind of. i think it's a hybrid staking proof of worth, if i'm not mistaken, kind of project has a good community behind it. from a chart standpoint, though not a whole lot here still looks like a really big base that's developing and i think until it breaks out of this base, i don't think i want to be doing much with this. uh, if you love the project and you think it has long-term potential, then this is a good spot to be getting in, uh, but the fact that it hasn't really broken out at any point is a little worrying because many of them have right. so this is one of those coins or projects that is lagging a little bit and it hasn't gotten a lot of support yet as far as i'm concerned. so that worries me a little bit. i wouldn't be overexposed to something that hasn't really moved all that much just yet, but not horrible big base. if eventually breaks out, then you can. it can probably easily get up 30- 50 from here if the market moves. but again, i don't like buying the ones that necessarily haven't moved in the hopes that they do move. i think that logic is a little flawed. i prefer to be late on something that's pulling back from an uptrend, like light coin did for so often. you know, buy, buy, the pull back before, um, you know, before buying something like this in the hopes that it goes higher, okay zil, no, nothing about it besides the fact that it looks like a very horrible chart. um, no sugar cutting this one. new lows- anything at new lows is a get out and avoid. that's my philosophy. i don't buy the whole. i just mentioned this in the last coin request. with decreed, this is even worse. don't buy something on perceived value. there is no value plays or metrics in crypto. this isn't like a stock where i could look at cash flows or revenue growth and so forth. these here, a lot of them- are based on the network effect and community and what people are willing to to pay from, and somebody here- well, most people here- are not willing to pay for this and whether it's founders or developers or people who have large stakes in this, they're pushing the market lower and people are not buying it higher. and, uh, that means you don't want to be the sucker that's buying and then getting, um, you know, pushed out. yeah, it's over oversold. yeah, it's at lows, big deal. um, to me, that means it's only going lower and, yes, at some point it'll probably reverse and the chart will look great and people will be like, oh, why didn't i buy that? it looked obvious. it's not obvious. um, it's only obvious when you want to look for, uh, the thing you missed. and that's what happens. a lot of time people look and back at a chart and say, oh look, well, look at that one big move there. well, yeah, they don't look at the whole 90 of the time that was going down. and this is a case here for zeal. in my opinion, these are the things i try and avoid all the time. lambda, okay, um, lambda, not much history to go on here. which is the first thing, didn't do much for months and then you've got one, two, three, four, five, six days of of a huge move tells me that this is probably some type of news driven event, some type of pump and uh, sell-off. i can't get excited about this. if you like the project, then maybe this is a good spot. right, it's come back quite a bit, but typically big moves like this get reversed almost entirely. so unless it kind of comes back to that breakout point, uh, or so close to it, then i probably would not be interested in something like this. if i was- even even if i was- interested in the project overall, i would have a smaller position in case it goes higher. but only look to really add my full position back to the breakout point. this is not coming off a sustained, nice uptrend where i would say, okay, the whole thing doesn't need to be retraced. this just seems more kind of uh, contrived or planned, and i don't like those types of moves in general. okay, nano had a big base, like a lot of coins broke higher sort of, started moving higher, great. but what i notice here is the pullback is a little more than i would like, um, so i'm gonna be honest with you, i don't like the. the size of this pullback here could be a nice buy, the dip opportunity. i would have liked to kind of settle back here around the, you know, a little higher above this point, let's. you know, i think if you want to trade this, i think you want to wait for this to come back above the 10 day and 20 day moving average and then let it re-establish an uptrend of some type before looking to get long. um, because it could. it's down the downtrend and it could continue all the way back down to kind of the the bottom here in march. uh, if it got to the bottom, you could probably look for a double bottom buy at this point. but again, that's a lot of technical damage for me. so overall, this for me is an avoid. i don't like much about this chart that gets me interested. i really, again, i don't really see any points where i'm like, yeah, i would want to buy back strongly on this chart, so i coin. i guess this one's been around for a very long time, but it's at 48 satoshi, down from 70, down from 120, at new lows for 2019, at new lows for binance. i know it's been around for years. um, nothing here at all. this is the same analysis as the one i did earlier. i think it was zil. new lows means get the hell out or avoid. um, yeah, if you want to like, play lotteries, right. i mean, a lot of people look at stuff like this and say, well, once the whole market moves at 48 satoshi, it's gonna only have to get back up to kind of this area. here i'm almost, you know, 60, 70 percent my money. yeah, but that's a good way to lose money. um, don't, that's just gambling. that's just buying a lottery ticket 50, 50 and saying, if it goes up, i double my money, um, but then of course, this goes down to 20 or 30 and then you end up giving it all back. so, or losing half of your investment there, uh, or half of your lottery play. i should say so. nothing here that i like. please avoid something like this. well, grin grin's not offering anything to to grin about um. it is just continuing lower and lower and lower. i think this eventually does something. there was a lot of exposure around this project. haven't heard too much about it now, but i think it's one of those types of projects that will eventually get a lot more discussion and then it may pump again very high inflation rate to begin with in the early stages of its evolution. but uh, yeah, i think for now there's just an avoid. i don't even think this is an accumulate. even if you like the project looks like it's still going to continue lower. give it some more time. um needs to establish some somewhat of an uptrend first before it becomes even a consideration, the key, okay. so another request: uh, a little worried. i'm getting kind of these requests here. people uh tells me people may be looking for kind of these bottom value plays, catching a knife, so to speak, thinking that uh like something like this. if it gets back up to- and if, of course, if it gets back up to that um 131 000 level, then that's a, you know, like a double or triple from here. yes, of course it is a double or a triple from here, but these types of coins lead people to put too much in, thinking they can catch up or, you know, make a significant amount, but most likely they end up getting caught in downdrafts and end up selling out, uh, just before the move. so again, i like to buy strength in the chart, i like to buy trends. these are the type of charts i like to short, can't short this market. don't see where the value is right here. uh, if you want to buy something like this, then wait for a breakout, wait for some confirmation. for example like: for example, draw a simple trend line. this is not exact science or rocket science, but at least tells you: here, here's the downtrend, right? uh, if you get a move higher and it breaks that level, then yes, you're giving up maybe 30 percent, 50 percent on the move, but this is the type of thing that you're looking for: three, four hundred percent type moves. so giving up the first 50 percent at least allows you to see that there may be a new trend established, something like that. right? so once you see a new trend established, and then you can find other spots where there are local highs. so let's just do a one there- i'm just just being very crude in my drawing here- but sort of finding spots right where there are kind of highs in there and drawing that, and that can give you the kind of the steps. once you start to see a change in that trend, the change in- uh breakdown, a breakout of the downtrend, then maybe these become candidates for going long. but i think the mindset people have is that they have to catch, catch the absolute bottom to get that three, four hundred percent move. but really what they should be looking for in this type like this is the way for this, the, the swing to occur, the change in trend to occur, and look for a 200 move. but at least then you're trading with a new trend, as opposed to finding or trying to find the bottom of a downtrend, because you could have tried it here and here and here and here and here, and if you get in here it may go down two or three more times before it does that reversal. so i think that's an important mindset for everybody to take in when they look at charts like this. okay, let's finish up with icon icx: um, yeah, it looked like at one point it was um. i think i have even traded this one long at one point and made some some money on that, but i have an old alert sitting here which i can now remove. yes, this here is near lows again, so don't like anything about this at the moment. i don't like the uh trying to like buy a double bottom or anything like that. i think you'd want to wait for a new trend to establish a new trend. the, you know, obviously again is higher highs, higher lows. nothing is really showing that. uh, you think you want to wait for a reversal. let it come back above a 10 and 20 day moving average. let's zoom in a little bit here. yeah, look at that, i think. until it recaptures, kind of that downtrend, breaks higher, then you can look for something that may make some sense. but right now there's nothing here i like. let it come back up and then we can look for long trades trying to buy the bottom. same analysis as many of the other coins: trying to find the bottom here. it's just knife catching it. it doesn't work that often. it works sometimes, but most times in the end it'll just cost you money. okay, so that's the analysis on the lightning coin report. thank you for submitting your requests. i hope you enjoyed this update and, overall, a lot to be positive about, a lot to um to be bullish about. but again, like anything, markets will shake you out and throw you off. the key is to stay grounded and key is to not over leverage positions. they will make you think irrationally and emotionally and that will lead to poor decision making. being calm and patient in the analysis being, uh, letting price come to you, letting price come and and and integrate with your own strategy is best. so again, all the best, have a great weekend and i'll see you on monday.
