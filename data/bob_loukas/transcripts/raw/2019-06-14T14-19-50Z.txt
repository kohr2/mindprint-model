Hello Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas, Friday morning in New York. I hope you're doing really well. This is your lightning report for the week. Thank you for the requests that you made. I'll cover those shortly. But first, let's take a look at Bitcoin as we typically do. And this chart is starting to look a lot more bullish than I had, than I was looking at, say, three, four days ago. I've got some sort of geopolitical news here with China and extradition laws in Hong Kong. I think that's a big deal in terms of capital flight and the use case for something like Bitcoin. I think that's having an effect. Binance is also talking about restricting, or not talking, are going to restrict US traders from accessing the, at least the original version of Binance. I think that's also a big deal. It's good for Bitcoin, not so much for the altcoins. But looking at this chart right now, in real time, we are above the highs of the prior cycle again, but we did not drop below the lows of the cycle low. This one here should be 54. So that's currently bullish. So we had a move to new highs, we had a drop down that did not make new lows, and now we're looking bullish again, back above the highs of the last cycle. So right now, it's shaping up as if it might, might, might want to make a run. But we still also have kind of a head and shoulders top possibility. Now head and shoulders top is not a head and shoulders top until you break down and, you know, break something like the neckline. So it's only something to keep an eye on. That would only become a scenario when we have something like this. All right, then that becomes a head and shoulders top. For now, it's not, it's only a possibility. What I'm looking for though, what I'm looking at is the fact that we still have a beautiful uptrend in play. This could just be a, you know, a decent consolidation, sideways consolidation, in a nice uptrend. We have to respect the trend. This is why I always say, since the four year cycle low is in, you want to be, at least in my opinion, denominated in all your accounts in Bitcoin. When you're not leveraged long, when you're not trading, sitting in Bitcoin will at least allow you to not FOMO into some of these moves. You'll still have a one-to-one relationship with the Bitcoin price to the US dollar. So you're not feeling as if you're missing out by not leveraging long on some of these moves. You're still taking advantage of the gains that you see. Now, right now, this could move really quickly and rapidly. We do have some nice indicators sitting in for a possible move higher. I think if we get a little more strength, I'll be looking to go long some of this. Could also potentially go long here and use the current low of the day at around about 81.70. It's only around, you know, $200 or so below. That could also be a possibility now, especially since we're back above the 10-day moving average and the 20 is starting to, sorry, back above the 20-day moving average and the 10 is starting to swing back up around. So it's starting to look really bullish again, but you know, I just want to be a little cautious because we do, you know, we did have 180% rally. This could still be kind of a counter trend move with this top in place and then it moves lower. So it's, it can go either way, of course, still, but respect the uptrend. I don't think you want to be shorting. Shorting is only to be had if you have a really, a really obvious position, a nice setup and a nice tight stop that you can maybe take a crack at it. But for now, I don't see any short opportunities unless we, like I said before, begin to break down from this area, form a right shoulder, come down and break this neckline. So that, and at that, at that point, if this comes and breaks down and gets below this neckline and below this cluster of candles, then I think that's bearish in the short to intermediate term. And then, yes, we could be looking at a cycle low in sort of late July or mid to late July, where it's going to grind lower. At the moment, it's not looking that way with this chart. That's why I said respect the, the trend, respect the strength that we're seeing here. And let's look for some long-term opportunities to, to get long, really considering a long position right here, maybe a little more strength, take a smallish position leveraged to the long side, and then probably have a stop at one of the these, one of the lows of these two candles from today or yesterday. And then that could potentially move higher from there. That's what I'm looking at for Bitcoin. Let's move on to the requests that we had in the other reports, starting with Ethereum to, to BTC. Let me just find that real quick here on my list. Okay. Ethereum, BTC, I am still along this position. It has not moved. It continues to consolidate. Bollinger bands got really tight. We'll hit the bottom of the bands, hit the top of the bands. Neither of those resulted in a directional move. Now we're back again below the Bollinger bands. And this concerns me, this now looks like it may want to come down. So I have my stop pretty tight. It's not, it's not much below kind of the entry point. So it's, it's a small loss if taken. I just want to respect the price action here. My, my stop losses are in place and I don't want to be messing around with Ethereum to BTC if it does begin to, to break down from here. So look again, not, not all that positive right now. It just seems like BTC is the go-to asset still. You will notice with a lot of the Binance, look with the Binance announcement this morning, that many of the alts are really underperforming today and struggling and they haven't really done much in a couple of months. So respect where the strength is to not try and front run a lot of these moves. Most of these altcoins are not cheap just because they're down so much. That's a typical value suckers play. Just be aware of that. So for now, I'm not liking this chart the way it is, but again, tight bands, it's still, still could be moving higher. It's, it's trying to find a direction right now. The low from June 9th could also be used as a stop, but my stop is not far below that anyway. So it's, you know, it's probably not going to hurt too much to, to keep it where it is at this point. So that's, that's Ethereum BTC. Next request was for Zill. And this is kind of a classic chart here. We, we see this quite a bit where we had this big down trend. We had the breakup, um, that we had the reversal. It stayed above the lows and now has made a new high. So this was looking really good up until four days ago. Um, again, higher, higher high, which is good. And then from a low standpoint, it held the low. So right now still looks decent, although threatening here, this, this, this candle today and yesterday, not a big fan of that back to below the 20 day moving average. So this is in danger of breaking down. I think if you are long this, whoever requested it, I think you want to be cautious right here. Not sure what your entry is, but this would be a worst case. I mean, you don't want to be long this, if it gets below this June 1 candle, uh, and that's still quite a bit of room. I would, um, I would be seriously looking at scaling out on some of this, um, maybe sooner than that, but just be, be watching this candle here. Um, it's breaking below the 20 day moving average. If it holds here and reverses, then this is a, then that would be a nice looking chart because then if we had a low around here, then it's kind of, kind of looking at the third low, which is higher than the previous here. It is here. So one low, two lows, another low, and then we have one, a higher high here. So the structure would be good. And the setup would be good for this to continue higher from this point like that and begin an uptrend from the reversal that started back here in May. And many of the charts have similar type of structures and the analysis is pretty much the same as far as I'm concerned. But right now, this is a little bit concerning, but you still want to give it some room and some patience. Second request here was for link and, um, chain link has had a great run. It had a great run here in May on some announcement. I can't recall what announcement was big pull back here, shaken out, shook out people and then come back up. And then yesterday, I think there was some, some new announcement, maybe with Oracle or Microsoft. I can't recall exactly that has pushed it higher. You know, it's difficult trading stuff and assets like this that have made such big moves because now you've got these huge wide candles and it's just a matter of where do you place your stops. And I don't like getting into positions like this. If you're not already in, I just don't see how you get in unless it comes back all the way to say the 10 day moving average, then you can begin to play around with that. I think if you're long and you got long either in this area here or just recently in this area here, then you have plenty of, plenty of room, uh, for your stops. The question is, you know, do you want to be giving up a lot of the profit? I think the spike here would have been the call to get out of some of the position and take some profit. Now it's just a matter of, well, you know, it's just very hard to put a stop in place here that makes logical sense. And also, uh, being in a position to take advantage of it, maybe moving higher again. So I'm sorry, I don't have much to offer you here. Again, if you're not in, I don't think you buy this until it comes back into this area. And then you can place a stop, say somewhere where I have the line. If you are already in, then you want to maybe consider taking some of the profit or again, finding a logical spot. Sorry, that's not very helpful, but, um, again, it's just a function of how far and how fast that's moved. I mean, this is almost a double in price. Uh, it becomes very hard at that point to, to, to, to look at it from a fresh pair of eyes. ICX is a another request and ICX at the moment is a sell. I think you want to be out of this. I don't think you want to be holding a position right now. This is breaking lower. It didn't do too much. Uh, if you look at this downtrend that we had over the last couple of months, it didn't do much, right? It barely got back to the 10 day moving average, a couple of weeks that got kind of sold off. It's if at best it's in a channel right here, the Bollinger bands are getting tight, but it's breaking down, not up. So that's also a concern. It's now below or at very close to this lows here on May 26 after being rejected at the 10 day moving average and now getting close to the lows and May 13th. So I think this is definitely an avoid. I think you want to be away from this. Um, I think the only time you're long, this is when it breaks back above this line here, which is quite considerably higher from this point. So yeah, I don't really like this chart at all. Oh, NT is again, um, a little similar to the last one. Uh, we, we, we had a breakout, but it really wasn't a breakout. It was more of just a consolidation sideways. And that to me is not a true breakout. That wasn't, didn't come on any, any sort of volume. Um, and again, Bollinger bands are tight. It looks like it's breaking, breaking down. Like a lot of the old coins are doing today. I think if you can kind of draw a wedge in here, which typically is, you know, typically a consolidation, um, before a continuation pattern. So I'm, I'm skeptical here. I don't like much about this. I think you want to see upside moves before getting excited and look with all these old coins. Again, I keep saying them, they have so much potential when they get moving that you don't need to front run. You don't need to try and, uh, and get a big position before we see evidence that it's moving, unless you're scalping little small moves, which I don't think is something you want to be doing. Um, if you're playing these big breaks or these big moves, we are looking for a double, for example, at 1600, up into this area is 3,200. That's a double. That's a hundred percent. So, you know, wait for, wait for evidence that it's going higher and that it's, it's making some short-term higher highs before getting in. Otherwise you're just, you're just buying ahead of a move thinking it's going to go somewhere. And most often they do not. The next one here is Adam. Um, I don't know anything about this looking at it for the first time, not a whole lot of history on Binance. I think it was the same on, um, the other exchange crack and that showed up. So I'm not sure if this is newly listed, not enough of a chart here, to be honest with you. Just don't have, it's just, just too little data. I'm sorry for, for me to give you anything specific. It does look like it's breaking down here in the short term, but you know, above the moving averages. So, you know, I think you've got this area here, which is considerably lower. Um, sorry to say, I mean, I want, I wanted to give you some comment on, on this, but I don't have enough here that, uh, I want to influence you on. Um, but you know, maybe a break sort of above kind of this, this, this area here. So using the tops of all these candles, maybe a break above that is bullish. And then this low or of the low forms can be the stop. But, um, yeah, I, I don't have anything more. I'm sorry to say about this one. Yeah. And then cosmos to us dollar coin, um, looks pretty good uptrend. So again, not much data here, but sort of somewhat of an uptrend. You've got, um, got a whole bunch of sort of wicks here that you can play with as possibly a stop point. Anything below that is a move below the 20 day moving average. So that kind of could be your, your point to get out. Um, and then this could be a consolidation before another move similar to this candle here as well. So overall, not a bad looking chart. Definitely. I mean, it's again, very little data, but the little data that we have shows an uptrend. So at least you've got that trend behind you. If you are long this. Okay. OMG, OMG again, similar to what we saw before. Nice. Well, not nice, but clear downtrend into May. Three candles higher. Like we saw many places, uh, many other coins showing us. And then a lower low, sorry, a higher low, um, not a higher high though. And then now a Bollinger bands are tightening again, not showing us a whole lot of follow through from the lows here in May. And then today's candle breaking down, looking at possibly new lows, at least below the May 26th low overall, nothing I like about this. This is threatening to the low side more than anything else, maybe a new move higher and back above, or at least to the top of the Bollinger bands, or at least above the highs on June 2nd and June 3rd, get you more bullish again. But for now, this is something to be worried about more than to be excited about. Raven coin was looking pretty good a few days or I mean, I think it was last week in this area here, but it has started to break down for red candles. It needs to find, needs to find a low pretty soon. Now that's below the 20 day moving average. Again, like the others, we had the breakout. We did not have a secondary higher high, although we had a higher high from this peak here. So the structure is looking pretty good for reversal. Not a long candidate now until we get back above this level. So we want to see a reversal here. That becomes kind of your stop point, right? But you want to see it come up and rally from this point, at least find a low at some point. And then boom, that's right here. That's kind of your point to get long, in my opinion, because you have the potential, like I said before, to make pretty sizable gains. So you want to see, you want to see evidence that you definitely have a low in place right here. And that we still have an uptrend coming out of this May lows that we have. So overall, not a bad looking chart, but looking, looking a little warrantsome in the short term right here. And the last request I have is for Tron versus USD. Overall, I think this is a very bullish chart. And I said this a few times before, because we have this huge, almost nine month basing pattern here with a somewhat of a inverse head and shoulders structure to it with the shoulders on the either side and kind of the head over here. We had this line here, which acted as resistance. Couple of times we popped way above that. And of course, this is a very volatile asset. So you get these huge wicks. A couple of attempts back over it now, clear cut break of that, possibly a retest of that breakout point, even though that breakout point is fairly arbitrary here and how you draw that. Even that said, even if you kind of moved it a little higher and move this a little lower, for example, it's still kind of at that level. I think this line here, which I drew last week is definitely a stop point. So at the almost 0.3 level 0.291, 0.2, 0.291, 0.292 area is definitely a stopping point as far as I'm concerned. Anything back below that is danger. So overall, this is still a decent looking chart. I think long-term it has the potential to go higher and much higher, but again, you know, it needs to follow through and start moving higher again, because it did show some promise over here and pulled back sizably at the moment and looking like it may want to continue lower again. If it goes lower again and this becomes kind of a trap, then a revisit of the 0.02 or even 0.015 0.05 area is in play. So be careful with that. You don't want to be riding a position lower like this if it does begin to break down, but still overall still looking positive with those caveats I mentioned. And with that, that concludes the weekly lightning report. Hope you enjoyed that. Again, I went through and I scanned through a lot of the altcoins, a lot of bearish action at the moment, a lot of green, so a lot of red candles, um, on the altcoins. Be a little careful with those. The Binance announcement I think is more significant than people maybe think. Um, and again, I think BTC is where most of the action is right now. And, um, you know, and that's, that's really evident right here in the charts. But again, we just need to see what Bitcoin wants to do here, whether it wants to kind of just, whether this is just a counter trend move before the big continuation lower, or whether it's going to surprise us. If it does make up, if it, I don't think we get a trap from here. I think what we happens is if we go up and make, um, a move to 8,800 and above, then it's just going to keep going. I think from there that opens up the opportunity to go for another good run to say, you know, 10,4, 10,8, or even 11,000. That's the kind of capability that this has because of the amount of consolidation that we've seen here and that we already have a trap in place right here. So if we are going to, if we are going to move lower, this is the trap. I don't think we're going to get a double sort of trap up top here, if that's the case, but just keep an eye on this. Um, looking for some more strength before getting long, all the best to you. Have a great weekend and wishing all the best.
