Good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas. it is Friday, May the 10th in New York. it is early in the morning here and I hope you're all doing really well. this is your weekly lightning report, where we cover some of the requests that you made in the comment section for altcoins and a couple of coins that I see that have potential. unfortunately, there isn't much potential at the moment as, as any active trader would know, pretty much every altcoin has been kind of slammed over those last three weeks and what looked what was an amazing April for a lot of the altcoins, or amazing February, has now turned into almost a complete 100% reversal and, in many cases, more than that, and we had new lows. so I'm gonna. so the charts aren't gonna look pretty. I mean, I think you already know this. it's not going to be much to talk about, so I'm going to turn this into more of a lesson than anything else. well, lesson so much. not so much a lesson, but more about what- what I did over this last month or what I didn't do more appropriately to avoid a lot of that, and in fact, this has been. may has been pretty much kind of my best month, you know, not so much my best month, but it's been a good month and I have done very little because of it, and that's because I've respected the market and respected the trends and I've been in BTC. when I'm not in an active position, I'm still sitting in BTC and BTC is up around 20% in the last month or so and obviously it has now almost, almost doubled off the bottom in December. so let's go into it. first, let's talk about Bitcoin, as we always do: 47 day cycle high. we have a high for the day. we are three big green candles here for a $600 move. I think this might be getting close now. I mean, I've talked about it for a while. I said once we made, once we broke out and made another high, then we could go up to up into that 6,000 to 6,200, 6,300 area. I think we're at the- at least we're at the max of where I thought any sort of move can go this early out of a, out of a bear market. if we draw the line- I've drawn this line- from this cluster before where it broke down, we're right back at that point, okay. so I think this is where you're going to hit that sort of uh, that that wall and get rejected. it's also fairly late in the cycle. I mean, it's not ridiculously late. we have seen in bull markets this cycle go up to day 55- 56 before topping out. but when you look at kind of the extent of this move now, at least from this cluster here back in end of April, about a couple of weeks ago, it's now up 20 percent and another $1,000. so you know, it's up until yesterday or day before, I think, the market was very skeptical and, as indicated by the amount of short interest, meaning the amount of shorts that were actually uh selling, uh, on margin bitcoin, it was too high. so I think a lot of them now have capitulated with this move. I'm not sure if a lot of them have necessarily turned bullish yet, and that's the only thing that uh sort of holds me back from saying we've topped, uh, we're still not enough bulls in the market. people are skeptical about this, about this rally. it's kind of the most um sort of hated rally or the least liked rally at the moment. uh, so people are behind this yet, which is good. it's good from a contrarian standpoint. you want, um, you know you want- a market going higher on bad news and with people skeptical and not really necessarily invested behind it. those are the best types of moves, of course, but again, like I said, we've come. we've come almost, uh, 60, 70 percent in one cycle here. this has been an amazing cycle. I think we need to retrace, but now let's just say we retrace from today or the next couple of days. here's the question: from 6300 all the way back down to kind of the start of the, the of the cycle is a significant move. I don't think we get that anymore. um, we, we may be setting up for a period where this today's high marks and this area here, the 63, 6400 marks, kind of the top of the what's going to become resistance for a while, and not sort of this 5600 area which intersect a couple of the other cycle lows. so if we kind of get rid of this line, now that we've exceeded it, uh, you'll see that the band is much wider and it's possible that as we come back down and make a cycle low, let's just say somewhere around in the 4700 area, that we then bounce around for a couple of cycles, kind of in that zone there. so you know, this is just, you know, for future reference more than anything else, but this is kind of. it could become the channel now that we bounce around in for the next few cycles, the um. the warning, of course, is that we still have this potential, in my opinion, for a big, big shake out. I'm not talking about a cycle low shake out like we're expecting soon. those are kind of normal and expected. I'm talking about a larger degree move, as this was a very large sort of degree move, more than expected. I think we we should get one of those to the downside at some point, either between May cycle low, late May, July, August or even September, sort of October. one of those three is going to give us a bigger shake out than we expect and that will be the absolute end of sort of the, the crypto winter, even though this is not a winter at the moment. also in the winter at the moment, um, but we will get one of those shakeouts. but for the time being, I think, short-term focus. if you've been long, if you've taken sort of some of the loads or some of the ideas here, um, to not short or to be long, I think this now is kind of the point where you're not necessarily hedging your long positions but, uh, you're taking your leverage off. at this point, I think the money's been made. yes, it can continue higher, always can- but I think the move has extended too much. I think now is the time to take some profit right here. 62 to 6400 area, but stay denominated in Bitcoin. this is what I when I said I want to make a lesson out of this. uh, I've been denominated. I've talked about this in previous videos and in comment section. I'm always denominated in Bitcoin. when I'm sitting in, let's just call it uh, because- for a bit of a lack of a better word- but when I'm not trading, when I'm sort of sitting in cash, cash to me means Bitcoin because for these accounts, my, my crypto trading accounts, my performance. once I want to measure my performance against BTC itself, and the reason I want to do that is over the next four years, four years- I have this expectation that Bitcoin in the four-year cycle is going to go and make another high at the $20,000 level and then a subsequent bull market top in the next few years at a much, much higher price. so if I'm trying to beat that performance, I'm already well and truly behind the game. if I'm sitting in in USD, um or a stable coin, uh, that's that's pegged to the dollar one-to-one, then I'm going to be missing moves like we've seen right here, and that's why I don't want to do that. I want to be sitting in and I mean, that was it was different. in this environment when it's going down. I knew we're in the bear market so I was more more willing to be a stable coin or more willing to be shorting, very often to hedge. but I don't need to hedge anything right now, even in the cycle low downturn, because I know we're in a we're in an upturn, we're in a new four-year cycle, so I just want to be denominated in Bitcoin, even when I'm not trading. and then when I'm trading long, I'm just leveraging Bitcoin to the long side. occasionally I'll take a short trade, not so much for a hedge but just to get some extra BTC as it's coming down, and then I want to go in and out of all coins just to increase my BTC position. and that leads me to my next point about if you notice in my alerts I don't recall the last time. let me look, actually right. so I took a May 3rd, May 3rd Litecoin long trade, a couple of Ethereum trades in April, and it's really not until you go back to March, where I really posted any real significant trades on L coins like ETC and ADA, for example, and BAT and Binance. those all look great in February and January and we traded some of those successfully because we had the uptrend in at our back and it was clear that the market was trending higher. once they started breaking down, the charts didn't look any good to me anymore, so there was nothing for me to trade. I like to trade with the primary trend and in the direction of the trend. when we get setups and pullbacks, okay. so none of the alts have been giving us any of that. so why- you know why- keep pushing the envelope on these old coins when they're all breaking down. it's fine when they're in a uptrend and they come back and you buy the dip, but once that stops working for you and once the first or second by the dip doesn't work, that means the trend has changed lower. I'm going to show you some of those now as examples. the trend has changed lower and you should be then essentially avoiding those until the trend changes. there's no such thing as value in the altcoin space. none of these have any intrinsic value that you can measure and say, oh look, this really should be worth 400 million dollars as a project and it's trading at 150 it's value, let me buy it. there's no such thing. people try. people just getting greedy with their altcoin trading, thinking they can double, triple, quadruple their money- and they can at certain times. but it's not going to work all the time. it's going to be in select bursts and periods of uptrending motion and you have to know when that is and when that is, you take advantage of it, and when it's not there, you avoid it like the plague and you you become diligent and disciplined enough to know that now is not the time to be trading because the altcoin aren't performing. let's look at litecoin as an example, because this was the best one, the best performing one there was. so each of these dips you can buy. it's an uptrend, it's beautiful, right, because you can trust. the trend comes back and touches the 10- 20 day moving average. sometimes you know drops below and you buy and you buy. and so this dip here you bought, right, right, there you bought that, and then it comes high, it looks good, and then it comes down. oh, you got stopped out. okay, then maybe you bought the next one, right, um? but then you get stopped out. but the point is that, right here, once you see the kind of trend is now broken, and then the- you know the moving averages are turning lower and trending lower, not higher. that's it, it's done. you're not buying that anymore. if anything, you're shorting at this point. okay, but- but without going into that discussion, um, you want to just be starting to avoid a lot of this. and this is the best looking chart that we have essentially in the altcoin space. the rest of them a much, much worse. look at ada, where we made significant uh profit out of that, um, all the way back and already exceeded the- you know the february and march lows. but again, you know you buy the dips, buy the dips, buy the dips, keep going up, but eventually, when it stops working, then you're out. you're not trading this anymore. but i saw so many people ask me: oh, i'm back in, i'm long ada, i'm long ada, what should i do? what should i do? and then what they're doing is they're coming all the way down here and they're saying, oh, it's got to be, it's going to go up, it's value in this, but there's no interesting value. this is just a chart and the chart is trending lower now and it's going down and they get to these points and they keep buying these dips, thinking that if i get positioned then i can be in it for the long run again. so if it goes back up, i can be in it. but you know there's no point in doing that because all you're doing is- um, you know you're wasting your capital, you're getting stopped out and stopped out, or you're holding a position when it gets into a deep loss and you just don't know how to get rid of it, thinking it's going to come back and i just have to hold. i just have to hold. but no, it doesn't work that way. with uh, with these altcoins, they can lose- as this has here- 50 percent, 60 percent of their value as fast as they can. double they can, they can lose it. so it's just a very important thing for you to point out. that's how i trade: um altcoins down, you know, 40, 50 percent versus btc. you know, and, uh, you know my whole portfolio, without doing much trading, is up 25 percent in the last month. okay, and now i have the mental capital to start to get ready to think about some of these reversals. so i know these are going to change, these are going to reverse soon enough. so i've got some alerts set on the trend lines right. so i i don't want to buy this now. this looks like it could be a bottom right here. but who knows? look at this trend: right now, the- the lows in december begin to come into focus. so what's stopping it from going all the way down to that, for example? so there is again no interesting value, no point where buying a dip makes any sense. uh, you need to look for a swing, you need to look for a trend change, look for, look for the 10-day moving areas to come up, start to trend higher. you're going to give up 20, 30 percent of that initial swing on the bottom, but then you're going to get an uptrend. and when you get that uptrend, then all you need to do is catch 70 percent of that move. right, all you need to catch. if we look at this move higher here, all you needed to catch was half of that move to make kind of double or 50, 60 percent of your money safely, um, without you know, very little risk. that's the type of move that we want to focus on and capture and not capturing it, trying to catch the bottoms. sure, eventually you catch one of these bottoms, um, but, but, but if you've already wasted three trades to do that, or if you've kind of doubled down, doubled down, doubled down and now your average position, um, you know, is at kind of the 1300 level, for example, it's going to take a long way just to get back to break even. it's just not a way to be trading, okay. so i'm sorry for the long 10 minutes, uh, or plus, rant there on altcoins, but there isn't much going on in these altcoins and i wanted to spend some time talking about trading these altcoins. just, you know, it's, it's. it's easy to look at people on twitter saying that they've tripled and quadrupled and the trade on some of these, but, uh, i guarantee you, they're very few and far between and, uh, sure you're going to catch a big one. if you're throwing darts at multiple charts, eventually you'll catch one. um, don't be fooled by what you see on social media. the reality is, you need to be disciplined when it comes to these, and discipline even more with with all coins than anything else, because they do have- they do have- so much volatility behind them and the moves are so extreme that emotionally it's very hard to actually trade some of these with size. because of that volatility and that movement. you have to be very, you have to be much more disciplined to be able to successfully manage that and be successful over a longer period of time. okay, so let's get stuck into some requests that you have, starting with ethereum. all right, ethereum, again more weakness. it actually has held up somewhat, considering and when you compare to other altcoins. but, look, i did think, um, the december lows would hold. it looks like that they're going to come under pressure, at least right now, although with bitcoin possibly topping out, i think ethereum may be able to hold its ground against, uh, bitcoin here and hold the december lows, i think, against the dollar. if we look at that real quick, um, i think it holds just okay. i think it may may fail below kind of this 130- 140 area if the whole sector, if bitcoin, starts to really come down for the next three weeks into a cycle low. but in general, i i'm 100, almost 100, i'm very confident- let's put it that way- that the december lows are in, in for ethereum versus the dollar. it's just a question of ethereum versus btc. this just shows you the weakness overall, or actually more illustrates the strength of btc than anything else. the capital right now is being accumulated into btc and everything else is taking a step back until that finishes. so i think that's going to continue. um, it's not until the next cycle starts, probably in the next two or three weeks, that i think we can see ethereum and the likes start to rally. all right, not too many other coin requests this week. i i'm obviously assuming that it's because of how poorly they've performed. but let's look at omg's. a request, sorry to say, but this one is uh at lows and you think you should know by now. anything at lows to me is not attractive at all. broke below the february low and now free fall- i wouldn't call it free falling, but uh, still making lower lows. 253 satoshi going all the way back here at 2000. that's just down 90 odd percent still. so i'm sorry to say that's an avoid again. uh, if you like this project long term, yes, you can get in. but i'm assuming if you like this you're already in. don't double down, don't triple down, don't try and average down your price. it's not worth it if it's going to do something in the long term because you like it. your position that you have is probably already big enough to begin with, so just hold it at that and and just wait. all right, dash was looking pretty good in april, had a good move off the bottom. now has lost all its sort of tranches here, um, back down. there's another example of kind of buying the dip right when this one stopped working right here and then you had the cross and now it's in the downfall. you don't buy each these levels, um, just because they were levels or steps on the way up. you're in the downtrend. if anything, what you do is you're short. these uh rallies back. for example, broke through this tranche here, found support. this one here came back up. see how it came and touched the 20-day moving average. that's your short right there, for example, because it isn't a downtrend um. but that said, somebody asked about dash. doesn't look great. let's look at the lows here from november, which was a long time ago. look at that touching it right there. so, yeah, it could bounce right off. this level could come back back all the way to sort of 19 000, uh, 19.5. but again, respect the trend. what if, if, if this trend is about to end and altcoins about to sort of rally again, then what you'll see is you'll see this come back up, touch the moving average back down, thinking it's going to continue lower, maybe double bottom, but likely come back down and then come back through. it'll break the downtrend line or break through the moving averages and then it'll start to do that at that point right here, at this next sort of break higher, then it can be bought right, because then the assumption is that we're going to start a new trend. but you have to let this sort of play out across the board and we'll probably see similar patterns in all the altcoins before we want to start buying these again. um, otherwise, the assumption is that the trend is going to continue lower and you're going to think you're buying a bottom, but all you're doing is just giving up more of your hard-earned capital on. t is actually not horrible. of course it has the downtrend, but staying, for the moment at least, above its december lows and its sort of february lows, drawing the line here still in the downtrend. i guess what you could do here is wait for sort of a breakout or, you know, a rally back up, put kind of a an alert on that. still has some time before it gets anywhere near that, but at least you know, at least it's holding up and, unlike dash, like we just saw in many of the other ones, it still has kind of this big, huge rectangle base going all the way back to august of last year. um, so once this trend starts again, it can move higher and then go through another move like this- but again, look look at this- from uh 1500 to 3500- well, more than a double. so with a double in play, um, why try and pick a bottom when all you have to do is wait for the trend to establish itself and then take and pick up just the double, or pick up, you know, a 60 move or 70 move. people are so fixated on a triple, on a quadruple in price that they end up giving it all away. um, you know, just just go for the, go for the big moves and take, take the majority of the move when you know the move is in your direction and in your favor, etc. another request now: i don't see anything i'd like, if anything. i still see one huge downtrend. pretty much, um, although i don't like, that's not really a trend, that's just telling me that's just more of a channel or anything else, but i'm just basically trying to illustrate that the trend overall is down. uh, yes, there was this breakout here because really the trend is more like this, but it's still kind of irrelevant. point is that, uh, this move here wasn't anything significant and when you compare it to the other altcoin space, that was nothing, was just a blimp, and we're already down to new lows again. so, again, anything new lows, avoid. um. i don't like anything about this project as well. 882 satoshi from 2800 and you know 4000- that's just that's crazy. um. so i don't like anything from a trade standpoint. i don't like anything from a project standpoint. so for me, the analysis here is just to avoid it. um, take your money and run essentially, even though it is at lows. um, it's, it's just not worth it. and the last coin requested is dogecoin. um, breaking below these areas. i think i drew this one in last week. it lost that support. uh, if anything, this here would be some support. that was a pretty big move here back in august and then, going further back, it does have lows all the way back in, uh, kind of. so this has done well overall and i talked about that last week. it's still, you know, well above kind of where it was in december, held up pretty much throughout the whole bear market relative to btc um. but you know who knows where it finds support. it does go through these huge spikes: one, two, three, four, five, some of those obviously milder than the others. i think it'll do the same at some point, but who knows if it's going to do that from right down here. so if it gets down to this december 17 support or area, that is only 16, 17 satoshi, and we're now at 39 right now. so here's another example of why try and catch a falling knife when it's- uh, you know when the potential for the move lower is, you know another 50 to 80 to 100 lower. wait for this to move up, set an alert if you have to um, and then, you know, trade it accordingly. but until while it's going down, just avoid. and so for now, for the person that asked, i think this is still an avoid um, and just wait for that swing. that's all i can tell you. that's just the way i trade: wait for a swing to turn and wait for at least evidence of a trend change that's in play. here's an example right here. right, see how it changes here. finds, finds, the bottom comes back up and the 10 day starts to turn, comes higher. let's zoom in on this a little bit, all right, so let's draw the line. comes down, finds a low, comes back up, comes back down. so this candle right here, that point there, for me becomes a little significant because as it comes down and it comes up, then that's kind of the more recent high comes down, almost double bottoms comes back up and breaks through. so now the trend has changed. you see, the 10 day would start to turn higher and then, after a few more candles here you start to see the cross. so this here is your trend change. then you come back down by the dip on the 10 day moving average right there and now you've got this move here. okay, this is an example. i mean, this wasn't even a significant trend change. it kind of started to fail over here. but this just gives you the kind of point that you want to see something happen first before you start to get bullish and trying to pick a bottom. all right, everybody. that's the lining report for this week. i wish i could had a lot more to tell you. but you know what the markets are like, that they ebb and flow and when they're going and the currents are going against you, you stay away. it's almost like you know, like going to the beach, right when it's a really bad day out and there's been stormy weather, the red flags come out and what do they say? no swimming, beach clothes or something like that. it's kind of the same thing in trading. if the currents are wild and and the patterns you know, fluctuating, there's a lot of volatility. don't step in there. just stay back and wait and be patient. wait for the right setup, because the the odds are not with you and the odds are not with you. you're trading. when you'll be pushing the envelope, you'll have a couple of series of bad trades or wrong trades and then you'll start chasing and you'll start to uh, make more and more mistakes. that's the wrap up for today. i hope you enjoyed it. i'll speak to you soon.
