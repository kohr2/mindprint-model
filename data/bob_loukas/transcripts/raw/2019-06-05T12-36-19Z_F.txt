Good morning Bitcoin Live members Bob Lucas again now it's Wednesday morning here in New York this is a top 10 market report gonna cover Bitcoin and the top 10 market capped coins in the crypto space so starting with Bitcoin I did an update yesterday afternoon so not much has really changed from that outlook looks to me like we definitely have on the daily we have a top in place question again is to what level or what time frame is this top going to occur there is a couple of interpretations here one is again that we do not have a cycle top until here on May 30th from the cycle low a nice big right translated cycle and now we just need sort of you know seven to ten days of a decline to complete this 60-day cycle that means that we could be looking at a low around the 71 70 200 area or we could even pop lower below 7000 to form that end of the cycle the second interpretation is that we kind of topped over here and we formed a quick either here or here cycle low and now we've topped again in the sorry about that we've topped I'll get this right eventually we've topped again here in a left translated cycle and now we have sort of six weeks of lower prices which could bring us all the way back down to kind of this cluster here at the 55 5600 area the reason why I'd say in this scenario we can go that far back it's mostly about time right if we have a left translated cycle with only sort of 10 to 12 days in then we have around 40 to 60 even but 40 to 50 trading days which is around six weeks of lower prices and six weeks of lower prices generally would mean that you would cover more ground than just say this extra $1,000 drop not a guarantee we could always just really consolidate for a really long period of time as well something like this come all the way back up kind of retest not retest but get to that upper deck or upper tier and then come down right and then you know come back up again so there's a number of ways this can play out and in a really bullish market this is definitely a feasible sort of outlook point is that now I think until we can recapture this area here or exceed it I think we have to kind of assume that we have some type of top in place and that we need to either work through time and consolidate all these gains or we need to see some deeper a deeper retracement back to you know for some profit taking just to clean clear the deck and clear the sentiment out that's developed over this long period either way any type of decline now all the way back to even this 5500 area is not bearish it's just part of a bull market process of you know two steps forward one step back or three steps forward one step back and for me that would just mean you know getting back in long leveraged once we sort of see kind of a low form and then some reversals and and maybe an uptrend back in the you know this the shorter term moving averages so for now just be patient with this I think the trades are are to the short side but not in an aggressive manner we are in a intermediate uptrend we are now in most likely almost certainly a bull market at a new four-year cycle so everything's kind of tilting upwards the bias is upwards so now we're kind of counter trend trading on the short side so we've got to be really careful with size you want to keep it very nice and tight not too much size and you know you just want to be mindful that if the market starts going higher again that you don't want to be forcing your view in the market from a short side the picking up short trades is purely just to take a little extra out of the market I think if you're not comfortable shorting or if you don't have the means to short then the alternative is probably just sitting in in a stable coin sitting in US dollars or whatever your local currency is and just being you know that's essentially you're just out of this decline and then if we do move back sort of above kind of this deck here I mean obviously obviously the all-time high of the wick here at sort of bit over 9,000 is a reason to be long again but I would say even kind of this 88-8900 area or even this high I'm drawing quite a few lines here but just to give you an idea this area here this top here at 84 even above 84 you kind of want to start to think again well you know I need some more some more exposure to the long side again because you just don't know what's going back on but so for now like I said I'm I'm actually short on the on the leverage side using just daily candles now just not a big position it's just a small position overall a swing is not going to really kill me but I'm essentially just going to take a trailing stop using these daily candles so I've moved it down now to the top of this candle right here the daily candle so around about 81-20 giving a little bit more room and just just writing that down so tomorrow if we continue going lower then I would just probably move this down to the top of that candle sort of around 7900 and so on just to um I wouldn't call myself it's not so much of a protection it's more just if we are in a declining cycle which we are to some extent um is if it goes down to 64, 6500 or even 5500 I want to have a piece of that so that's why I have just a small short not designed to to sort of be a killer trade for example and also not a time to be sort of getting really aggressive on the long side from a leverage position I don't think trying to buy dips right now is is the right solution I think you want to see because we do have kind of this trend change in place and we can see the 10 day is going to start to really accelerate lower and and at this rate in a couple of three or four days it's going to dip below the 20 day moving average we have a decline in place I think you'd want to see at the moment at least this 8100 level taken out on the upside and maybe close above that on the daily before looking to get long leveraged again until that point I think now we still have with with a break below price below the 20 day moving average and a close below the 20 day moving average that's really the first big close below the 20 day moving average since kind of this area here and this wasn't really a big close below uh it was sort of hanging off the 20 day this is a you know a considerable break of the 20 day moving average so I don't really like that so this tells me here that we could be in for a little more a little more downside and definitely some headwinds going forward okay so that's the analysis on bitcoin I'm going to now move over to the top 10 coins and of course starting with ethereum and I have I still have a long position in ethereum btc still the same looking chart looks like a flag but no longer a flag this is too long but we do have some nice consolidation here and it has held up relatively well considering bitcoin is down you know 15 or 1800 so it hasn't participated as they did in the past on the downside at least held held its ground versus btc so this is doing pretty well so keeping my long position here pretty tight stop still all right um but uh yeah just just holding it now and this is a matter of being patient and seeing if the market does want to continue higher after these three huge candles maybe two or three weeks ago now is it possible that we get or can we see something uh like this kind of the same trajectory going all the way up right that would be ideal that's kind of what I'm playing for a move to sort of the point zero four area would be a another 25 or 30 percent gain from this point and that would probably be enough for me to at least take some good amount of profit but of course that's the move um for us to even consider that the bollinger bands are tightening up a little bit which is good um so I think a move is coming let's just hope it's not to the downside I think we want to play this one fairly tight in general um as well on the downside let the market go up and make some profit otherwise otherwise on the downside let's just take you know take kind of a break-even trade and move along if it does break down xrp ripple is actually looking pretty good as well it's a similar looking chart to ethereum I also have a long position here as you know stop relatively tight I have it just below this bottom wick here on the candle tightening of the bollinger bands getting really tight here and it looks like the downtrend might be over we do have a move up a lower low still looking for that lower high I think if we can get back above this level here then that tells me to definitely have a trend change in place although I don't necessarily want to wait for that that confirmation to get long and that's why I'm in that position but above that you may even want to consider adding to the position because ripple when it has moved in the past has gone on a sustained run so this it's not too late even though you know kind of given up 40 30 of a move already we know that ripple can kind of double in price if not more but so anyway tightening bands again as I said this still looks pretty good to me but again it can go either way anything can go either way of course but I think if a theorem I think these are all correlated as well so this is where I'm saying be careful with a lot of these big market cap coins that have very similar charts it's a matter of picking which one you like the most which one you feel more comfortable with but I wouldn't go with too many of them because again they have the same chart structure if if the top 10 sort of diversas bitcoin drops they'll all drop and you'll get stopped out across the board and that's going to add up very quickly so just pick two or three at the most and you know be comfortable with that position all right bitcoin cash actually is really tight on the Bollinger Bands and we do have evidence well I wouldn't say it's an uptrend but we're not so much in a downtrend anymore so we could be looking at a kind of a big squeeze like we saw here and a move higher this is an opportunity maybe to take a long position and get a really tight stop in place here and see if we get this move higher I'm not taking it but I think that's on the offering right here based on how tight these bands are and you know with bitcoin cash it can move rapidly when it does get going and then bitcoin cash versus the dollar yeah in a nice uptrend now um starting to move higher 398 400 down up from sort of the 120 area it's had really big moves that this this chart doesn't give it justice let me zoom in a little bit yeah so um bottom here and then higher this is a nice uptrend I think versus the dollar this is still a probably a good long trade here maybe this dip from 480 down to to 360. wow this is a again like I said this chart doesn't give it justice big moves here overall but uh we could be looking at a bottom right here but then again we could also be looking at the fact that it's dropped below the 20-day moving average like bitcoin could be looking at a move back down very hard to say bitcoin cash is a difficult one to trade I do like it versus btc more than I do against the dollar I think this one here with the tightening of the bands looks like it's going to move in some direction at least and if you can play it tight yeah you may be giving up a you may be getting stopped out relatively easy but you you have a big reward opportunity if it goes in the right direction eos does not have a similar structure to ripple and ethereum and litecoin this was a little different had a nice move over the last six or seven months and the last couple months it's been retracing back lower but we did have a nice breakout we had a nice move higher so now this is a good opportunity I think to get back in long and using this may 23rd low as as your stopping point offers a good you know a good tight stop with a good reward potential up to new highs for 2019. of course dependent upon all the altcoins all the majors making a move against bitcoin and the bitcoin dominance level going down but this one has demonstrated an ability to to rally well and to be well supported so you know this is something it's something you could buy right here and again use this as your stop and the third position I'm along is litecoin I think this one still looks pretty good I want to see a resumption of this really big bull trend had a nice um orderly type of um decline here and and profit taking over you know a little over a month but you know looks like we've broken out and now we're sort of flagging here consolidating looks more like a bull flag than anything else and I think we can make another leg up and get up to this sort of 0.015 and 0.016 area as the next step up and continue kind of the pattern that you saw at the end of uh at the end of last year and earlier this year where you see this nice step up pattern right you get consolidation step up consolidation step up that's kind of the pattern for litecoin it looks like we're going to get something similar here as well so I like this this is a comfortable trade for me right now long this one as well let's just see where it goes yeah binance coin is um obviously had an absolutely amazing stellar run over the last six months I'm not too bullish on this chart right now unless we see at least a breakout back up above the may 25th highs but certainly to all-time highs for now it looks like we're maybe you know starting a downtrend a new channel lower it has obviously moved a very significant amount um so yeah this looks more toppy than it does anything else and it's just a matter of waiting and waiting this one out I don't see a long trade right now and then against the dollar looking better against the dollar certainly a nice uptrend still in place here but coming from a four dollar level to 30 you begin to question and you shouldn't really question uh value versus price uh those are very often not very well correlated but at some point I'm starting to think you know at multi billions and dollars worth of valuation um where's this going and it is it's not a security after all you don't own the company with this token uh it's just utility so I'm not sure how much utility there is but if you are along this or if you're kind of you know in an investment position or a long long term position this still looks like a beautiful looking chart to me we do have nice legs higher on the dollar versus the dollar so for me there's real no reason to to be getting out of something like this and if anything kind of a move back into this 25 26 dollar area I think it's a snap buy and let's see if we can come back up again or even if it can sell that sideways for a little while longer get these bands bollinger bands getting tight again you can look to take a trade again just give it some room um here to move like you saw this move here give it some room on the downside uh take a smaller position so you can maybe write it because again this is the type of thing if it continues this trend it could be at 50 by the end of the year for example so if you're taking that intermediate term uh trade just give it that space so you don't get stopped out on these kind of moves lower because it can it can sort of drop you out of position as well all right no secret that I'm not a fan of stella um from a chart perspective as well nothing to be that bullish about this looks similar to ethereum ripple and some of the others same type of structure although this one has not broken out yes it's can it's consolidating well the bands are getting tight it could easily explode higher but I think if this one explodes higher then so will ethereum and so so will light coin and others and I prefer to be on the ones that are showing more strength as opposed to something like this that's showing weakness because on the downside if the whole sector moves lower this will be the first to go lower because it has been weak in the past so for me this is an avoid and I just don't like anything about this chart structure ever since it broke down back in December I think the dynamics have changed um or the fundamentals have changed for stella ever since that point all right ada again similar to ethereum we had the breakout pullback it stayed above the previous low that low can now become your stop point bulger bands getting very tight all similar structures again if the rest of the coins move higher out of the structure so with this I'm not sure which one is the best one to trade I think it's all going to come down to a matter of preference personal preference how well you've been tracking and trading some of these coins where you're picking the one you like the most but again looks very similar as far as I'm concerned to the rest of them and should behave the same way coming out of this this structure okay so tron is probably the one that looks a little different to the rest it seems a little more advanced it has a nice breakout I wouldn't call it a big clean breakout but it has a breakout of this downtrend and we also are out of this channel um on a longer term time frame so it looks like now we have a couple of higher highs so higher highs and higher lows in place so this looks pretty good to me I'm just worried that some of it's hyper related to recent um Justin's uh comments or the the auction with Warren Buffett for example even though that shouldn't be moving the coin like this this one does have kind of that clicky uh following so that one that kind of worries me a little bit but this is definitely an opportunity here to maybe get long in a longer term time frame looks like it maybe found a bottom and it has plenty of upside room to go so if you like tron or you think you want to give it some exposure on the long term side of things I think there's a good reason to do that right here um long good long-term opportunity for for tron I think I'm not sure fundamentally if it's great or not but um I think it will it will at some point with with the rest of the space make that move higher and at least get to getting into this February highs or above and if it does that that's you know it's at least a doubling from this point versus BTC so plenty of room to go on tron and then versus the dollar it has a nice breakout here working here so um you know there's opportunity here as well I think all right let's just wrap up with another look at BTC at the weekly level nothing nothing out of the ordinary here um this big red bar is needed and is welcomed in some ways um putting price back inside the weekly bollinger bands which are very wide I think there is room here now for some more consolidation let's hope it's just orderly let's hope it comes over maybe three to six weeks come back down I think that would be good for the bull market come back down to kind of the 6,000 60 100 level I know that sounds painful and they're 20 decline but a move back here would really reset sentiment reset the bull market and then we can get another move from there that could easily double or more and a double from the 60 to 6500 area is of course 13 000 so move back up to 13 000 by the end of summer early fall wouldn't be obviously be very welcomed but I think we want to see that from a retracement and a consolidation area as opposed to seeing it from right here seeing it from right here now up to the 13 000 level makes a little too parabolic for me and runs the risk of the market really collapsing hard and fast and taking a lot longer to recover okay that's the wrap up for today I hope you all enjoyed that I actually have a family funeral to attend on Friday so there won't be a lightning report I'll get that out on the weekend all the best to you
