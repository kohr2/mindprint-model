Hello Fintech members. It's Bob Lucas. It is Saturday morning here as I'm recording. Change of format slightly. I'm going to try and provide all the charts I'm going to cover in the reports but then do a narrative of my outlook on this as opposed to typing it out. So kind of a hybrid between showing and providing all the charts and then just talking about them. I'm going to try and provide myself a little clearer and maybe a little more detailed in doing this in a narrative form as opposed to typing it all out. So let's just give this a go. If you have an issue with this new format, please let me know. Send me an email. Otherwise, I'm going to give this a go for a little while and just see how it goes. Okay. So let's start with gold. Gold Daily here looks ... I mean, it's a wonderful looking chart. It has sort of that rocket element to it. Really surprising move. I think for a lot of people, I mean, I was waiting and ready for the investor cycle to end. More than ready for a first daily cycle. But I think if you were not able to get on fairly early to this move and get positioned early, once it hit that upper Bollinger Band, it was pretty tough to try to get a position without the fear of it coming back down and stopping out. Half the problem also is that it wasn't really a confirmation until we kind of broke above this day eight high. The last time we had a breakout like this here in the last cycle, it kind of fooled everybody. Everybody thought, well, for sure, there's got to be a new ... it's got to be a first daily cycle. It has to be a new investor cycle. This here was a very significant trap. I think almost everybody got trapped into this one, at least everybody following gold who wants to trade gold. I think that was kind of a normal thing. Then we had to come back here. Did not form a failed cycle on the daily. That also fooled a lot of people thinking that this move cannot be part of a new investor cycle. I got in fairly early this time, fortunately, and have a good position holding it now. We are kind of extended. We definitely traded six days above the Bollinger Bands. It looks really solid at this point. We're already at the point where we've exceeded the prior weekly cycle high right here, at least on an intraday standpoint we have. Not on the closing, but that I think is telling. It also could be telling us that this move for now is probably just short-term exhausted or short-term overboard. And I think a pullback is not surprising and expected, even though if it keeps going higher, the way this market is structured right now, it could continue doing that. But I think we get a pullback. The cycle count is such around day 13 or so where we're also looking for a pullback into a half cycle low. The first daily cycle can easily run to 28 days just to a top. So there's plenty of time and plenty of room left in this one, but I think a pullback towards the 10-day moving average or even the 20-day moving average by that point would be a very good place to get back in long or to get in long, I should say, if you missed it. I don't think you lose position right here. You don't sell this early in the first cycle. If you took a bigger position than you normally would and maybe sitting on a bigger profit, you can take or maybe take half the profit right here. It's also a possibility. But there's plenty of room here. The way this moved higher, the near vertical nature of this tells me or at least has me thinking that we could be in for a really big surprise here on the upside. I don't want to get people unnecessarily sort of excited, but this is significant, the way it's moved here. It kind of reminds me of the rocket sort of move out of 2015 lows when kind of the bear market ended. This has sort of a similar feel to it at the moment and nobody's behind it. Everyone's kind of not believing it at this point as well. Nobody's talking about it. So from a sentiment standpoint, really not much has changed, especially with the market, the stock market up this past week. People kind of like, ah, forget gold. It's not really telling us anything that's going to drop. So that could also be working in our favor from a contrarian standpoint as well. Let's take a look at the miners here on the daily chart for GDX. And we had this beautiful little triangle here. It looked like it was going to break lower, but actually broke higher. First candle here was a full body inside. And then just launch. And it's just been nothing but a lift off ever since. Pretty, quite a bit of strength here on the RSI. Definitely overbought. But, you know, again, don't be surprised. Pull back to 10-day moving average. That's a buying opportunity, in my opinion, based on this structure. But, you know, when miners get into kind of a crazy mood or a mode, and maybe they're in one right now, they really don't look back a lot of times. So I'm not losing my position here because this is the type of thing that could just keep going for at least the intermediate timeframe, like the next few weeks. It has done that, and because it's rocketed so hard and so fast, I just want to be positioned in case it does do something like that. And then on the weekly chart here, I mean, there's plenty of room left here. On the weekly chart, it looks much more sustainable, much more orderly. Just two big weekly candles here, recovering the decline for the investor cycle. We have around about 9 to 10 weeks of decline here in the cycle, and we've recovered all that in two weeks. So that, to me, is very positive. Even this move here, I mean, this is coming from sort of 18.20 all the way up to 25. So if we get something similar to that, we're going to get a move up to a rose about $28 at this point, and that would just be match or mirror this type of move. But you can see my point here is that once it gets going, the miners, until they kind of top, they just keep going and going and going. So I think we've got something like that in play right now. I wouldn't be surprised in a week's time when I'm doing this video that we have another candle all the way up towards $24.50 or $24 at least just by the way this market has started to move so far. So then silver looks like it's now finally moving. It was definitely lagging. And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to get positioned. Even though it wasn't the strongest, I know that silver does move at a much faster rate when it does get started. And the fact that it had not pushed through yet, or it had only just pushed through when I traded this, to me, it was something I wanted to take advantage of because if gold was confirmed in a new investor cycle, there's just no way silver would not participate. So we're seeing that participation right now. It's already up. I'm not sure if it's close to 6% or 7%. But it's looking pretty good. It's back up to the upper Bollinger Bands. It looks like it may pull back slightly or even keep going, right? Again, we see kind of these moves here. When it does get going, it doesn't really look back. So I wouldn't be surprised if we eventually get a move up to this sort of $16, $16.50 move as well. So a good 10% or 12% move from here in a short period of time is something I would be expecting out of silver. All right. So finally looking at gold at the weekly level. I mean, it's pretty clear, isn't it? I mean, we have 27 weeks up. We have 39 to the ICL. It might even be 36 to this point here. It doesn't really matter. There's a consolidation period here. Didn't break down hard. Didn't get capitulation like we see in all the other prior investor cycles. I think that in the end is going to prove to be bullish. I think there's a lot of buying and accumulation that is occurring in this area. And then once that cycle ended, once the selling pressure was relieved, we have this two weeks, two week handle here of an almost $100 move back up to almost touch, or to touch kind of the point. I mean, that trend line is not perfect, of course. But we're in that area now at 1350 where we've seen gold over, I think it's around three or four years now at the top of every investor cycle has come to this area of resistance and has been rejected. Difference here is that we're coming to that top in week two, possibly even week five, depending on where you mark that candle. And that's early in the cycle. So we have a lot of opportunity right now, probably to consolidate for a week or two into that half cycle low for the first daily cycle. But then in a week, maybe even two weeks, come through and try and make an attempt to break through that resistance and to go up into the $1,400 area where from there, there is a lot of upside potential and very little overhead resistance and supply as far as I'm concerned. So I think all the supply, the overhead supply is in this area. And if we can get through there, it's probably going to be a rush of new buying as it escapes the area and allows the breakout to really gather some momentum. That's what I'm thinking. But we still need to see a breakout through this area. We could, in theory, also chop in this area for five, six, seven weeks, keep testing, maybe even break through and then get failed. So we need to see or I would like to see this test and break through very early in the investor cycle because then that tells me that I think it has or wants to break through and make some significant headway into kind of the $1,400 and maybe even into the $1,500 and slightly beyond. That would be ideal. So we want to see that early in the cycle. But overall, I mean, there's really only positives to take away from this. We had a very long cycle that consolidated very little, stuck just below the 10-week moving average. So there's nothing bearish about any of this as far as I'm concerned. And it's not any secret that really since kind of 2017, early 2018, I've been talking about this resistance area. We've been talking about the attempts to break out. And we've also, from a longer timeframe, been talking about this very, very wide base that looks like gold has been forming over the last four years. And we're right at that junction again. We're at that point where it's testing that resistance area for that base. And breaking out of that, I think, provides gold with a big opportunity to make a nice new run into highs that we've not seen for a while. All right. So I think we have some really confusing type of action here in the equity markets. We without a doubt have a clear cycle low as far as I'm concerned on day 44. And I think it's just too long of a cycle to make this part of the one cycle that began back here in March. For me, even though we don't have a clear sort of top and a day three top is kind of early, it still is a cycle low here at this point. So to have this move come down and fail tells me that we're now in the declining stage. Makes sense. Third daily cycle. We are 20 plus weeks in. Nothing wrong with that. But this type of strength here is kind of confusing. It's very rare to see this level of strength come all the way back up when you have a failed cycle in place. But it's still perfectly valid. That's kind of my point. So it's rare but valid. I think where it becomes borderline invalid is if we exceed the day three high. At that point it becomes very, very unusual. See, it's a real outlier. But it's still not invalid in the sense that we can have a failed cycle and we can have a move to make new highs for the cycle. We really just can't have a move or we should not really see a move to make a high above the prior daily cycle. So in theory we can have this kind of shake out move or bull trap move that's occurring right here. We can go above the day three high and form maybe like a day 17 or day 18 high and then roll over. What would be very, very unusual to see. I can't recall seeing one to be honest with you. But if we go on to make new all time highs from here, how this gets, you know, how this gets marked from a cycle standpoint would be something I have to put a lot of thought into and consideration. I think in the end what would end up happening in such a case is that this here becomes the second daily cycle low. I don't like to do that for convenience, especially when you have a clear cut cycle low like this, which is also another reason why I don't think we go on to make new highs. I can see us making a new high for the daily cycle, like I said, but not new highs overall. Again, time will tell. We need to see where this market's going to go. We had some pretty, I guess, bearish news, economic news this week with some of the manufacturing reports and also the payroll employment numbers were very weak. Now they can be weak month to month. We have seen that before. They are notoriously noisy statistics. But overall, I think there's a lot of evidence pointing towards a significant slowdown. And let's be honest, not being political in any way, but the current administration's policy towards tariffs and trade is one can argue long term beneficial. But in the short term, it provides a lot of uncertainty to companies and corporations. And I think it cannot be helping overall manufacturing in the world economy. So I think that's also playing a role here. I think the market is trying to reflect some of that, but it's also trying to balance the economic downturn in the data that we're seeing with the fact that we have a Fed that is much more in communication with the markets and much more open and dovish in telling us that they are looking at statistics and the data in real time fashion and are prepared to act in a very sort of quick manner. And I don't think you've seen that necessarily in the past with previous Chairman, Fed Chairmen. I think they've been more prepared to let data kind of sink in and confirm weakness before jumping in. So I think the market has some feeling at least that the Fed can manipulate the markets enough or the economy enough to keep it afloat. Now I think history has told us in the past that once the Fed starts tightening, sorry, once the Fed starts loosening, that it's already too late at that point. The data is too far gone. The economy has turned. And we know from the study of cycles that once a cycle has topped and turned, it's very difficult to pull an asset or an index out of a cycle decline or cycle top and change that. And the only thing that we've seen that come close, well, more than come close, but that's been successful in maybe turning that, is that when you throw a substantial, you know, something very substantial at it, like quantitative easing, for example, which was at the time something that was really unheard of. And then in subsequent declines, for example, this past, well, this current decade, there were times after QE1 that the market started turning down again. And then we went to QE2 and QE3 and different variations of quantitative easing that has helped propel and hold the market higher. I think at this point there's an expectation or there's a thought in the market that quantitative easing is no longer really an option or not an option that they'd play. And that's because they have rates, higher Fed fund rates to play with. And so I think what would happen is that they would have to play with those rates lower and then see if they have an effect on the economy. If not, then they could look at something like quantitative easing again. But I think by that point it'd be far too late is what I'm saying. So this is all very short term in the chart right here. And what I'm talking about is obviously a lot more long term. But the market is a pretty good timing indicator for the broader economy and corporate earnings. And we have seen in the past that the market will top out probably nine months to a year, sometimes longer, before the economy is eventually declared to have topped and formed a recession. So some of the data is still very preliminary from the economy standpoint. But if we're looking at, say, a 2020 recession, the market's then a top here in May. And it's actually perfect timing with regards to that. Now, I want to be hesitant in calling recessions and calling tops. I think we want to let the market play out, of course. So I'm just playing on the fact that, yes, we still have a failed daily cycle in play. We had four really nice days, but four days is just four days, right? Even though there's good breadth in the market, it looks like a strong move. At the moment, we still have a decline as far as I'm concerned. And I just need to stick with the idea that we're still looking at the markets in a failed state, looking for the next or decline down to the next investor cycle low. That's on the daily. If we flip to a weekly, then we see those four days as one massive bar. And these types of—the only thing that concerns me here for the bears or the bearish narrative is that big white bars like this typically start off investor cycles. I obviously didn't do it here, but I've seen it throughout. I did take a look back. So, that starts in the investor cycle. So, is this the start of a new investor cycle? Very unlikely based on the daily cycle structure. We don't see how that could be the case. But I really can't ignore this candle. This candle is really impressive. But is it just a snapback again? It could go either way. We are still below the 10-week moving average. I think if we see further upside, further confirmation on the high side, and then we see the daily cycle form a new high, that would push the weekly candles above the 10-week moving average. At that point, I would be really thinking that something else is going on here, something that the cycles are not telling us, or we should at least ignore the fact that we have a failed daily cycle and something else is going on. But at this point, still here, the bears should still be in control from a pure read of the cycles. We still need to consider this as the top for the cycle. This is a decline, and this is just a snapback. We did see a decent drop too. If you look at that, that's a 250. I think it is a 220 point decline in the S&P. That's pretty significant over just four to five weeks. It could just be a matter of this is a counter trend move back to the 10-week moving average. Even the last time we had the correction in the end of last year, not near the last cycle, we had something, I wouldn't call it similar, but we had a similar point decline at least. We did have two candles here that came back to the 10-week moving average. We also had another one here as well. So this for now is something I'm watching. We're all watching. It has stopped me out of my short S&P positions. Unfortunately, I had maybe a little too tight, but at the same time, didn't think price would be at that point based on the way the failed cycle occurred. May look to get back in short again, but at this point, I want to see what's going to happen this week. If we can begin to break down again, then I think there's plenty of downside room to get short again. I want to give it some time. So just a takeaway here, I still believe we're in a decline. I don't see the evidence for a new investor cycle, but again, a little cautious by the strength that we saw this week as well in this market. I'm also a little confused, to be honest with you, just talking more longer term here. We have the bond market really being bought. Yields are down substantially. Gold is up as I've shown you, but equities are up this week as well. So that correlation is not going to remain in place for much longer. So the question is, who is bluffing and where is the real money going? Is it back in the market here or is the money going truly into sort of the safe haven assets, the bond market and gold and so forth? I don't have the firm answer right now. As you can tell, I'm leaning on the gold cycle being correct. I'm leaning on this equity market here being mostly or only a counter trend move back. Another reason why I still think equities have some downside here is just purely based on how the crude oil market has responded or has not responded. I think it would have bounced much faster and much more if the equity market rally was really going to be sustainable. At least this is a warning sign, I think, for the equity market. But so far this move has been really good for the short side. Took some profit probably near the bottom actually in this case on half the position. That was pretty much one of the best trades of the year. Good 10, almost a $10 decline. Caught most of that move, which is great. Still have a decent short position. Going to see how it goes here. I think there's plenty of room. I think we should see or we will see crude probably pop back over the 10-day moving average. So I think there's still more upside room here. It looks like it's swinging and it's going to make a move up towards maybe the $56 area. So we're going to have to sort of bear that with our short position and just be aware of it. At some point, probably this candle here getting above, I'm not sure what the number is right now. I think it's $56.40 or $56.50. Getting above that level, I think, is going to kind of spook me out and say, okay, well, maybe we're wrong and this is the cycle low. But again, going back to the equity markets and not knowing where to place that cycle low, even though these don't have to be perfectly aligned and they're often not, I think they were crude and equity markets were mirroring each other. So I think we have the cycle low in this place here, which is roughly where we've marked the equity market cycle low. And then we have this decline here. There's no other way to mark the crude oil cycle. There's no way this is a cycle low. We know it's right here. We know we have the top right here in a failed cycle. And this is the reason why I think the equity markets too are in a failed state right now. So they should be close to a top at least. I'm using crude as something to help me perform that analysis. So for the daily cycle here for crude, we know that once it gets going, obviously the last cycle into the end of the year was a huge, huge crash in price. I don't know if we get that again, but starting out that way, it's looking that way, it's riding the lower Bollinger Bands and it's made a good 20% decline, if not more than that, 25% decline from the top. So it is in many ways mirroring the decline that we had back in November and December. I think we can, or we should at least keep riding this short lower. We should see if we can get the market to come back down to the sort of 44, 42 area, which would be huge, of course, for our position. The weekly chart, just like the equity weekly chart, looks a little more bullish right here, have somewhat of a hammer candle that's formed. We have some oversold levels, but only just touch the Bollinger Bands, the lower weekly Bollinger Bands on the way down with that reversal. So, yeah, I mean, you know, that could be sort of at the point where you find an ICL. But again, as I showed you with the daily cycles, the daily cycles aren't ready to form a low. The timing is just not right. And this decline just does not look like it's complete. So again, I think it's just taken and extended itself too far too quickly to the downside. I think it snaps back maybe one more week and then continues lower. But as we can see from previous cycle declines, that once crude gets going, it just keeps on going and going and going. Same applies on the upside, but so I think we still have more room left in the downside here. I think we get at least three or four more candles lower, which is, you know, about a month or so. And that allows enough time for the daily cycle, the third daily cycle to complete and form a low. Right now I'm kind of marking the best case scenario for crude. I think really the goal here is that it comes back down and maybe it's going for a double bottom at some point with the December lows. I don't know if it goes below that level anymore. I think OPEC and other players are going to be positioned and ready to intervene a little more there. But I think they also want price to be affordable, sustainable. I think there's, you know, a pact there with, you know, with the US government to get this price down. And so I think a price in the $40 range is really the target here, maybe the mid to upper 40s. But I think that's where I'm seeing this investor cycle go. The analysis on the dollar chart is pretty clear cut and very, very clear from a cycle standpoint. They've been very consistent on the daily timeframe, looking at sort of 14 to 20 days and then 8 to sort of 12 days from the top. Very consistent moves, very consistent cycles. And now as expected as well, we have a decline that broke the prior cycle low, formed as a failed cycle. I think now we're looking at a cycle low at this point. It's right in the timing band again here on day 18, which would be sort of a perfect count. We may even get one more day lower. Then we rally, but we don't have anything that looks anything like an investor cycle low. We should see one more daily cycle which will fail. Don't know how much it bounces. It may not even bounce back and above Thursday's candle. It may just get to sort of the 97, 97.2 area and then reverse lower. And then we have a probably a full daily cycle, could be 12 to 15 days of lower action, three weeks lower, down into probably what's going to be the next ICL for the dollar. I'm going to pull up a weekly chart so you can see exactly what I'm talking about. And here it is here. It's already begun, but we don't have the ending portion of that. It looks like based on this that we're going to break below this kind of lower boundary line that's forming as a rising wedge. But at the same time, there's also plenty of room left in the wedge that we may even get another investor cycle of higher action within the wedge, narrowing price action that eventually, based on the technical analysis of a wedge, breaks down and comes down into the next sort of three or four year cycle low on the longer time frames. But for now, it's holding up in price. It's doing relatively well, but we are, I think, now topped for the investor cycle. It's been a decent run higher, but mostly I wouldn't call it sideways. It's it, but it's trending higher, but mostly sideways at the same time. The question is now is how much lower does it go? Does it go down, touch the lower Bollinger bands? It's really hard to say. It could also begin the breakdown from this wedge with this cycle. So we could see, for example, three or four candles lower, clean break of the lower boundary, and then form the ICL, let's just say 94, 94.5 on the index. Then it could rally up to touch the lower boundary line there, and that could act as some resistance. And then that can roll over quickly, say week three or week four in the next investor cycle, and then spend 12 to 16 weeks mostly lower. That's also possible, and then we can get a move all the way back down to 90, and maybe even back into the 80s as well. So that's something I'm just looking out for for now, just focusing on the upcoming daily cycle, which should be left translated, which should be failed, and which should form the next ICL for the dollar. I think obviously the bias is to the downside. It's looking bearish. The counts are bearish. This is going to help gold, and it's just a matter of how much do we get out of the dollar right here. All right. Let's finish up with a little bit of Bitcoin analysis for you, for those who like to dabble in the cryptos. So Bitcoin here is probably struggling a little bit right now. It looks like we may have the analysis is a little mixed. I got to be honest with you because we've had such an amazing run. We had this $4,000, $4,000 move higher. So right now it's difficult to say whether or not we're just consolidating before another move higher. I think right here we have a 60-day cycle low, and we could. We don't have a perfect failed cycle now because we don't know if the cycle low is here or if it's here, but we're getting close to the point where we could have a failed cycle in place. And if that's the case, then we have only sort of a day 10 or day 12 high with this candle here on May 30th. And then we're looking at a possible 40 to 50 trading days of lower prices over the summer months. Now that would be normal and wouldn't be a horrible thing seeing a failed cycle right now. So if you zoom out a little bit here, we clearly have a lot of room here to consolidate with this move here from the $3,200 area in February to $8,000, $9,000 needs some pullback. So that would be normal. I think a retracement of around about 30% or so would also be normal. That puts the price back to around about the $64 or $6,300 area. So at the moment I'm leaning slightly bearish, not really shorting that I took one short here that ended up working out pretty well. Just got stopped out yesterday on lowered stops, but for profit at least. I think it is going to continue lower at this point, but I don't want to be pushing the short side all that much. Just yet because again, Bitcoin has been so strong. It's now clearly out of the bear market lows and it's the type of asset that can easily just rocket higher for another $2,000 or $3,000. So picking the short targets at the right times and right now, just it's kind of just waiting for another opportunity. We do see across the 10 day to the 20 day. I haven't really seen that in a few months. Getting back above this $8,200 area, back above the 10 and 20 day moving average would probably shift my view on where we could be going. But for now, the bias is to the downside and bearish and just looking at what we can, you know, what we get out of this market. So that's the Bitcoin analysis. Hope you enjoyed it. And I hope you enjoyed this sort of new format for the report. This is a fairly long video at 30 something minutes covering the four asset classes I normally cover. But I think it allows me to get a little more detailed in my view that I can't normally do in the sort of the written form. And I'm also providing the charts with some little bit of written narrative for you as well. If you just want to sort of skim through some of the sections. If you kind of know what, you know where the cycles are, you know what the asset is doing, or if you don't have any interest or position in any one of those, you can kind of just look at the charts and skip on the video. So let me know if you have any thoughts on this format. Love to hear your comments. Otherwise, happy trading and I'll speak to you soon. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
