Good morning Bitcoin Live members it's Bob Lucas Wednesday morning in New York hope you're doing really well so today we have just an update a midweek update here from the full weekly report that gets published on a Monday so this one should be fairly brief but overall I guess the the most important thing to cover is the fact that we have a decent little reversal here when it looked like we were rolling over into kind of the big window timing band that we have coming up fairly quickly for a cycle low so this here is a little surprising to me I did post an alert that I put in that a trade that I entered for short Bitcoin I'm out as of 4,000 it's already at the 40 20 this morning probably my my most expensive trade for the year it's been actually a very good year so far very few stop stop trades at all but this one probably is the most stinging for the year that's just the nature of trading I guess you know we just have to look back and only you can assess the trades that you make and see if they were the right ones for me looking at it today it's still the right one we did have a I think it was a day 34 day 35 sort of peak in here and then started rolling over then it started accelerating lower kind of broke it broke what trend line was in place at this point okay so we broke the trend line broke below the 20 day moving average for me this late in the cycle that is a short trade candidate it didn't work out and that's just the nature of trading we have to live with it as long as the as long as you can look back at a trade and still say yep it was still okay for me then that's the right trade the fact it doesn't work out does not make it a wrong trade but now what are we looking at here well we've got some more strength back in the market so I think this is telling us that it's just not ready to turn over yet it's not ready to move lower and it's telling us that we may even now with this recent sort of strength on the four hour chart as well that we may move back over these two candles that we had during the week kind of get the bulls a little excited again at this point so move back over this level is 40.55 if it gets back over 40.55 it may even accelerate short term to the high side and get up maybe to towards this area here which the top of this candle was 41.90 so a bit of a range in there but um I think if if people get excited about it again it could kind of do this maybe get up into here and then falter and then begin that move lower kind of get a little deeper into the timing band for the next cycle low hard to say you know um but I think the longer this goes sideways or the longer it goes sideways and higher the less likely it is that we'll get a massive drop and the less likely it is that we'll drop below the December low because the reason for that is simply that you need time for decline even though Bitcoin can you know can easily four thousand dollars in a couple of days there's no question about that it can make up this ground in a flash still the longer it trends sideways and the deeper we get into the 60 day cycle the kind of the more bullish it becomes overall um so that's that's a positive news to take away from this but overall I don't go chasing a market like this not on day 49 of a cycle I think any move higher here is just I wouldn't call a sucker's rally it's just late late a late cycle type action that for me does not interest me and again I've said this many times before if we do get a surprise to the upside on the break I'm not going to necessarily chase that at all I do have um obviously my futures account sitting in BTC so it's not the end of the world if it goes higher and of course we all have um we all should have kind of a cold wallet investment in Bitcoin as well so not a bad thing to see Bitcoin go higher overall and even if it's a surprise some type of surprise cycle that it just keeps going higher then again it's it's not it's not something that we necessarily be trading but it's not a bad thing overall so it's really the downside I want to take advantage of because we are late in the cycle it's also the downside I want to hedge and protect myself from if we do move lower at this point another thing this action is probably telling us and more likely telling us is that we should never forget we should zoom out a little bit always so let's zoom out here and talk about what we've been talking about for a couple of months here is that we're in a crypto winter space right so crypto winter I've talked about the sideways chop for two to three to even four 60 day cycles so we are trending sideways we're not trending higher are we're not trending lower anymore at least not for now so in the sideways trending market we should not be too surprised when we don't see these perfectly arching cycles that occur just like the last cycle we really expected it to dip lower and it stopped on day 53 right now we could be looking at something similar as well where we could get I'm just going to draw this in with a different color let's go with blue so we may start to get that that roll over here kind of just form a low high in this area so another higher high and then sort of chop again sideways right anything is possible at this point in a crypto winter the idea of a bear market in this point of the cycle is that it frustrates the hell out of everybody and it forces people to start to think about all these alternative scenarios all these different strategies because they want to understand the market people by nature want to have an explanation and they want to they want to just understand what is going on because if they don't they just feel lost and if they don't have a good plausible sort of bias or understanding what the market might be doing then it becomes difficult for them to place a trade and we want to trade we want to sort of fulfill that need to to be trading and you know without kind of a we had a few squiggly lines in the chart it makes it difficult to do that and fulfill that need that's why I try to avoid trading in these types of environments I don't want to be forcing my view on the market just to fit a trade narrative just to get a trade on the board so just be aware of that in general we just need to accept the fact that we need to be patient at this point we need to be patient maybe for another month maybe you know two or three months I don't know exactly how long but we are getting closer and closer I can definitely assure you that we're getting closer to the point where we start to break out and form a new trend now I don't think that trend goes to the downside and I've talked about many reasons why I think any move lower and I mean lower sort of below kind of these two cycle lows that we've had in the recent past I think if we do go below those that's not a new trend lower it's just a to trap more than anything else but I think ultimately we do or we continue to trend sideways and eventually we break higher and eventually we start to build upon cycle after cycle in a very methodical and not so exciting way but price will tend to go higher over time we just need to be patient with the market overall okay so that's the analysis on bitcoin not much of an update except for the fact that we have a little bit of a mini reversal here that looks good on paper but when you kind of zoom in it's not a whole lot either all it's done for the most part is sort of negate the the trend lower that I thought was occurring so open trade here that is working out really well is ADA looking looking fantastic at the moment took a third profit looking taking another third profit soon getting a little vertical and has and is vertical I did draw many weeks ago the kind of this this idea line that I have a trend line that I was looking for potentially for it to occur and that was fairly aggressive and this is already well and truly sort of more vertical than that that idea so my only concern is that it does come back to earth but the nature of this chart looks really good I think we can get up to this green line want to take some more profit at that point and then I just want to let a lot of it ride so want to start to move the stops up to even past so past break even at this point at the moment is set below the candle here on March 22nd which is well above the first entry but not above the second entry so we'll be moving up my stops to the second above the second entry making the second entry a profitable position and also obviously the first entry or what's left of the first entry a very profit a very profitable position as well and that's also in a worst case scenario I'm trying to get to the point where I can move the entire stop probably below this candle here that looks like a logical kind of launch period so it came up it consolidated a few days and down to this area but I want to give it a little bit of room still before I do that I think if we get another candle higher then that certainly will become the stop there's no doubt that would become the stop at this point but again I just want to give a little bit a little bit more room and then the idea the idea is if it continues to go higher then we'll just keep sort of laddering laddering stops at certain points where it comes back down but we're not there yet we need to see another move higher hoping that we this consolidation here even though it's only two days hoping it kind of gives us another one of these none of these candles so from here kind of to that I'm going to copy that so we get the same width the same length and then from there to there so yeah that kind of gets us it kind of gets us up to that that 1800 area that I've been talking about as well where I think we'll probably find some resistance from this move but again overall still looks very good and just be patient hold your position don't get don't get greedy don't panic sell just hold and take profit as I said before on some small position so you can ride the rest higher quickly take a look at a theorem because it is the major um not doing a whole lot and not not as well book bitcoins outperforming this because this is a bitcoin to ethereum chart um so bitcoin has outperformed it uh in the last couple of days so not a whole lot of strength here for this I don't know where I keep moving this sideways as it moves sideways but I still think it's going to break lower into the next cycle low um so overall this is not as bullish as you'd expect and then even against the dollar very tight bands here holding kind of this this this line here this line goes back to a prior sort of cycle low during the bull market so not as significant in short term here has no real bearing so we can probably just move that out of the way for the moment but yeah overall um not a whole lot here tight bands uh but you know again the cycle low is expected in the in the near future which means I think that the bands resolve themselves lower first but um hey you never know if this if bitcoin's gonna put in a very flat cycle this may go very flat get really really really tight on the bands and then just rocket higher as well ethereum does have that capability so just gotta keep an eye on it as well zrx was zrx was on my watch list sorry about that I just moved my I just played around with the alert and it went off but uh zrx is um looks like it's kind of formed its bottom here in the short term and it's moving now above the uh the trend line and riding up along the top of the bollinger band so this here is a potential long for you if you're interested if it fits your style um this kind of point here last few days would be your stopping point I would think anything below that is certainly an out but also if you want to get really tight you can kind of use the 20 day moving average as a um as a guide for potentially getting out if a move is below that but this looks pretty good some good strength in here this could be a good move up to maybe even this trend line here at 9 000 so that would be around about 20 move if it does do that lastly I've also posted zen as a trade alert in this section I think this still looks pretty good it's consolidated again I think this can move higher um but I do if you are riding this long you do want to keep it nice and tight uh this may be too tight here but this is kind of if this is a consolidation after this move up and this this line I drew last few weeks before that just indicating that this is how these this is how these these coins move they make a surge higher and then they trend sideways and they make another surge higher they all have a very similar kind of pattern so once you see a consolidation period and once you see it move high again you can move and you should move up your stops to those that cluster because anything coming back and breaking and violating the bottom of that cluster typically is topped so I don't know here if this is enough of a move I think with the wick up to this area tells me that the cluster here is now the bottom for this little move so if you have been riding zen higher I would continue riding and I would just use a nice tight stop you may want to give it a little breathing room for example like maybe three percent below that line whatever that is just for some uh you know for some some room uh for it to move higher but in general this is still a nice uptrend and a nice chart this could if you let if you give it time and patient could make its way all the way up to sort of 2000 and beyond so I hope you enjoyed that one just going to finish off here with a look at Litecoin um I'm not sure if I've covered this for a little while but this chart looks great still this is a nice looking chart uh here's the idea with moves up consolidation moves up consolidation so if anything we've consolidated nicely kind of a running higher consolidation as well which is even more bullish so I think this can continue higher at this point can break out of this sort of zone let's draw it like that and then make a new up kind of like I could make a new consolidation here and then go again so this is a nice uptrend you always want to respect nice long trends like this you don't want to fight a trend like this you don't want to try and short a trend like this you just want to say uh I it's too much too rich for me I can't get in right now or you just want to ride these type of trends never want to short them so this looks really good to me I think this can go higher um once it breaks once it can sell that in this area of course the only caveat is again that we have a potential cycle low coming up very soon but then again the February cycle low did nothing to uh even though that was a mild cycle low for Bitcoin itself it did zero to to like on if anything it moved higher uh as well so uh that's that's the only risk the risk though I think is that it comes sort of back into this zone here and then moves higher as well so that's the update for this week this is just a midweek update Friday is the lightning round that's going to be a pretty lengthy uh 25 to 30 odd coin request look for that late Friday morning here in New York time eastern time in the U.S. and until then good luck and I'll speak to you soon
