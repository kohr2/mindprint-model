Hey, good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas, Wednesday morning in New York. hope you're all doing really well. this is your brief midweek update on the cycles. had a full report out on Monday. I suggest you go and check that one out. that one has more detail on the daily and, more importantly, the weekly chart. but right now, a couple days have passed- still some more consolidation, I think overall this chart still looks pretty good to me. I'm sorry I know a lot of people were starting to get bearish or concerned that we might drop. at the moment the chart looks fine. it's it's holding up well. I think it's consolidating. a couple of big candles that we saw early in the cycle up well above the Bollinger Bands now come back into the Bollinger Bands, I think, still consolidating. so overall it's an early cycle count. it is showing some very good strength overall. the only negative, I guess, is that I do think we have a ceiling still in play with this kind of $6,000 or $58 to $6,000 area. I do think that would be a ceiling, but that still is more than 10% above our range right now. so I do think there is time and there is certainly room price-wise for this cycle to fill in kind of this gap here all the way up to the $6,000 area. now, of course, it doesn't have to test that $6,000 or $5,800 area in this cycle, but just because we have broken out of this, this multiple cycle zone here and now that we're in this- let's call it- no man's land, where there really wasn't a whole lot of price discovery, if you look back in November we only had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight trading days in this 42 to 5800 range, which is $1,500 range. that is not a lot. there is no real significant support or resistance in this area right now. so it can and probably will sort of fluctuate in this area. I would think I don't think there's an immediate danger of it retracing all the way down. if it does, then it's probably going to be more something like this, where it's just going to do more of a back test of this breakout and then come back up again one more time before coming back down to the cycle low. this is kind of how I think it's going to play out right now. of course, no crystal ball, but this is just. I think we're in this extra zone here above, above this tight trading range that we had. but keeping in mind, overall, that we're still in, we're still in kind of those crypt, that crypto winter phase, even though we're beginning to kind of come out of it a little bit, we're still going to be, we still should be, kind of trapped in this below trapped in this below six thousand dollar range, I think for some, for some time to come, and maybe even all the way out to to kind of the the later months of the year, definitely into the fall autumn of this year, I think we don't get up and above six thousand. so that, that being said, I think we still continue to chop around. we just need to pick our spots from a, from a trading standpoint where we leverage up is going to be important because we don't again have a clear range or clear trend. I should say, although now for me, where my bias back in January was for a downtrend bias for a bear market downtrend, where I was holding my shorts longer, more keen to get into shorts, and if I was going long I was sort of keen to take profit early, I'm no longer thinking that way. I'm thinking I'm more biased now to the upside, although I don't have a bear, a bull market sort of trend bias on me at the moment. but I do think that we are now in more of a an accumulation uptrend than we are anything else and for that reason I am more willing in my trades to let them ride a little longer, move the profit targets out further, take less profit, I guess, further up front and just give give trades in general a little more room to give me more, more profit. so that's kind of how I'm thinking and approaching the trading at the moment. but you know I'm looking for a leverage trade on Bitcoin. I don't see it right now because, like I said before, we could retrace back fairly easily and still be very bullish and could easily still go up and test that $5,800 area. that doesn't give me a whole lot of room here to- at least you know, to get positioned behind any one of these sort of scenarios, whether it's long or short. so I prefer to just sit on my hands when it comes to Bitcoin for now and let something develop a little more clearly and cleanly for me to enter into. I think where there is some opportunity is probably in Ethereum. Ethereum did very little during this last kind of it's called Altcoin pump, even though it wasn't anything significant. it didn't do much at all. but now it seems like, when everything else has sort of settled down somewhat, Ethereum is making a move. now I'm looking at this more against the dollar at the moment and we definitely have an ascending triangle that has broken out. I like this breakout. so I've taken a long position versus the dollar, looking at maybe getting a nice big move up to around about the $240 area, but maybe even at least the $200 area, which is it could be another 10-15% from here, take some profit around there and then maybe let the other the other half ride up towards $220-$225.. I like this chart a lot. it looks pretty clean to me and it can and does support- that's why my stops are fairly low at the moment. it does support a potential move back to kind of this $162 area before making that move up. that's also a possibility. but I do like the, the structure of this chart and the nature of this chart. I've taken kind of the, the longer or the widest portion of the triangle and applied that going forward up here and it kind of projects a $240 range. when you look at Ethereum further out in the scale versus the dollar, $240 really is peanuts, even even kind of. this area here, where it broke down right in November, is $222. this little peak here is $257. so getting back to this area doesn't do a whole lot. it's not like it's going to be a ridiculously, you know, significant move or anything like that. getting back into that zone, if you zoom out is, is pretty insignificant and not that surprising, I guess. if you look at the fact or if you believe the idea that December marked the four-year cycle low, I think this looks like a decent setup to me. so I'm long this for now. let's just see how it goes. my entry was a little late. I actually got in a little earlier slightly, but then then my alert was posted. but still, ideally the the right spot would have been probably more around the $170- $172 area once there was sort of three or four percent separation from the breakout point. that would have been the ideal spot. but I'm still comfortable because there is a decent amount of upside potential here. so the rewards aspect of it is pretty good. allowing me to just say: okay, I'm still going to take this trade and see where it takes me. 156 right now is sorry. 153 is below this candle right here. 156 is right below this candle here. so it is. if I zoom in, my stop right now is mirrored on this bottom of this candle right now, right here. so that gives the. that gives the free the flexibility to come back and retest the breakout point. and the breakout point is not exactly clear because there is a little bit of action over here. but this candle here and sort of this candle here gives us some room. anything below 156 probably is not of any interest anymore and at that point would be below the 10 and probably the 20 day moving average as well. so that would be a point to get out. so this is what I'm doing here with with ethereum, and then I posted that I got out of the Monero Bitcoin trade, just wasn't doing anything, guys, and I'm not afraid to close a position for a for a loss. I prefer a partial loss than a full loss on the position. but also it clears my mind. I don't have to babysit it, I don't have to watch it, I don't have to let it sort of play on my mind here. the fact that my initial thesis was the breakout of this triangle and it came back in gave a little time here to sort of get back and recover and then just languish for another four days since. so for me that's that's a pattern that's no longer working. so why be in a position at that point? clean up your trades, close them out, who cares if it's a technically a loss on the scoreboard? a smaller loss is better than a larger loss. that's the way I see it. capital first, win loss ratio is kind of irrelevant. when, when, when, when. really capital and capital in your balance, capital in your account, is really what's more important. and then the other open traders: Tron versus the dollar. TRX broke slightly above the. it's not really a breakout point necessarily, but just using the- the highest here back in January and February. it has a nice structure. this is the highest point you can draw. you can even draw a kind of get some of these other peaks over here. I think it has made a move higher. it looks really good. there's a very deep base, so I took a long just based on that. let's see how it goes. gonna give it some some time here to develop and it does have a nice run over the last couple of weeks. it is already up around 20 or 30 percent. so it's not like it's early. but I do love the base that we have here and I do like the fact that it has well a lot of significant room up to the upside. first target would probably be around about. I would say that, you know, maybe this up this area up here where these two candles are so more like the point zero three eight, point zero three nine, maybe even close to the four cent range as well. so just keeping an eye on this for now, just to see how it goes, hopefully to move higher, we can move up our stops closer and closer, to break even as quick as possible, but for now just just giving this a chance. I talked about ADA in the past. I still have a small long position around a third that I'm going to keep and wherever it goes it goes. it's pulled back, healthy pullback over the last seven days and maybe now it's sort of coming back up. this is the original line that I drew, so it's come back to this point. let's see maybe it can go higher. if it does go higher from here and maybe come up towards recent highs, then I can really move up my stuff even more again. but this last final third that I have is a patient position and that's the type of position I'm going to let ride and hopefully we can see Cardena come all the way up to sort of this 2400 and maybe even the 3000 level over the next month or two. so that's more of a longer term. let's just call it intermediate term play. now that I've taken out a couple of good profit points from this trade, let the rest ride and see what it can give us. if it's a good, if it's a bull market in play right now, something like Cardeno could really do well, I think, going forward and this can be a significantly big winner. but worst case, it's going to close out for not so much of a loss. so that's what I see here on Cardeno. somebody made a special request for XRP. XRP still continues doing the downtrend, if anything. if you look at the Bollinger Bands here, we're starting to hug the bottom of the bands. we ask continuously weak. this is a very weak bearish chart in my opinion, and I've been talking about this being in a downtrend for the longest time and it's pretty much been occurring. look at this trend line that I had drawn- many you know- some time ago. it was kind of hugging that trend line and now you see separation between that trend line as it moves to the downside and now it's definitely hugging the bottom of the Bollinger Bands here. so it's pushing a couple. you know it's pushing a standard deviation there, still going lower, looking weak. I don't know where this goes, but I can definitely see a maybe a double bottom with this October low, maybe even below that. there isn't much of a trend, but the short term, the more recent trend, is definitely down. so for me there isn't anything too uh, too exciting about this trade, about this, about this coin, at the moment at all. and lastly, let's look at total market cap, again, excluding bitcoin. I like this chart, this one I've. I think I'm going to be focusing a lot more on when it comes to the altcoin space, altcoins- here, this is just purely from a dollar perspective, so it eliminates the bitcoin noise, it eliminates the pricing in bitcoin. and so total market cap- all crypto excluding bitcoin- doing really well, broken out, seems like we have a bottom in place, we have a reversal and now we have a consolidation. here. uh, could move slightly lower, but then it looks like we have a new trend high at this point. so I'm very encouraged by this. I think this is very good news for the entire space, good news for 2019, good news for potential bull market coming at the end of the year and next year overall. looking, uh, looking, promising. okay, my friends, that is the midweek update. I hope you enjoyed it, as always. any questions, post them below. my next update will be on friday, which will be a pretty extensive covering of 30 plus coins, the lightning round. look forward to it. until then, be well happy trading. watch the risk. thank you.
