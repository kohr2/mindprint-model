Hello Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas, Tuesday morning. Special update today of course after a nearly 1000 point, actually more than, actually about $1,000 move in Bitcoin overnight. Huge, huge move. Really powerful, really surprising. Well, not surprising, but surprising to the extent that it went. And overall, just really exciting. Now, this does have many implications on the cycle and what we're looking at. But let's just put that aside for one second. Look at the bar that we have on the daily chart here. We had a couple of tests of this sort of area here. I personally did not expect it to break out right yet. I thought we'd get a pullback into a sort of mild cycle low here and then go out and then push higher. I did say if it went up, I would not necessarily trust that move and would want to wait for a pullback. Now, I don't have a long leverage position on this, but I do. Obviously, I'm not hedged. I have not shorted except for one attempt. And I essentially am denominated in Bitcoin. So overall, I'm still long Bitcoin, one to one to my coin. So I'm happy to see this, but I'm happy to see this for another reason. I think this almost all but confirms December as the four-year cycle low. And that's really important because then that starts to put into perspective the fact that we are indeed in an accumulation stage or phase of this early four-year cycle. So a new four-year cycle almost certainly now. And that means that we should start to see these cycles make higher highs. And we already see that, of course, here. This is not a higher high, but this is a higher low. And then it all depends on how we look at the current cycle. Now, this is where cycles can, in real time, not provide the most absolute detail that we need. And we have to accept that. And that's because right here, we have a couple of different alternatives, different scenario accounts that we're looking at. But in both cases, they are pretty bullish overall. It's telling us with this breakout that we now have higher highs, of course. And we have five-month highs to some extent, or four-month highs, I think it is. Four-month highs, an uptrend, you know, 30% or 40% off the bottom. This is all positive news. From a cycle standpoint, there's two things that could be going on right now. We either have a day one cycle low, sorry, day one cycle, meaning the cycle low is right here. Looks very odd. And this is the case that I talked about where you have a time-based cycle low. So all the selling was not able to push it down in the cycle low, too much buying, and then it rockets higher in the new cycle. Now, for this scenario to be my favorite one, I was expecting that to happen, and I called this out yesterday, I was expecting that to happen in around seven days and not so much right now, meaning that I wanted some more sort of time-based consolidation in this area, wait until the weekend, then do just exactly this. So the nature of this move tells me it's a time-based cycle low, because of the power of this move. I just wanted to see this happen kind of later in the week, a little further in the cycle. So that's the first scenario. Second scenario is that we still are on day 54 in the cycle, but we're making new highs very late in the cycle. And so what we may see now is a beginning of a pullback down into the traditional 60-day cycle count, but maybe only retest the breakout point or maybe slightly below that point just to shake a few more people out and then go higher. In this case, we're talking about sort of a day 60-ish give or take. Let me take that away. And then here's your cycle low there. In the traditional timing band, we know budget is higher in price. So those are your two scenarios. Both scenarios are bullish. Both scenarios show a higher low, no matter what, basically. And in one case, a higher high. But the second case, a higher high in the third cycle. So if this is a cycle low here, this was a cycle low for this small short cycle, which was not a higher high. But then this cycle high is already guaranteed to be a higher high because we have this bar on day one. So either way, very bullish. In terms of how to trade this right now, here's the hard part, right? Because you've got this massive move. Now we can easily see another 50% retrace. So it's really hard to be long here in a leverage standpoint when you've got this type of bar. And even if you zoom in, I think if you go to the one hour chart, you'll see that most of that happened here on one hour, within one hour, maybe even just sort of one and a half hours. So there's a lot of short covering right here. A lot of people who were either short or had positions to trigger a short were stopped out. So a lot of that could be reversed at some point today or tomorrow. So it's just hard. But then a lot of it might not, right? This could be just consolidating those gains and now it could move higher again. It's just hard to say. It really is from a trading standpoint. If you want to get leveraged, you know, it's hard to get that position. Now, obviously long-term I've been saying you want to have that position. You don't want to be messing around this late in a bear market. You want to be fully loaded. I think I even mentioned that in yesterday's video. And you know, if you're denominated in Bitcoin in your accounts, then you're still sitting fine, right? You're still exposed to the upside price in Bitcoin. The question is from a leverage standpoint, how do you trade that? Now, if we get a pullback towards this breakout area, that's an absolute buy at this point. You have to respect the strength of the chart, the strength that we're seeing in this market and buy a pullback at this point. But in terms of where it goes even further from here, I mean, if this is day one, then this is the problem, right? We could see, well, not really a problem. It's a good problem, but we could just see this. And I think that 6,000 area becomes resistance for the entire cycle. I do not see us exceeding that in this cycle. And then we do something like this, right? But how do you, how do you trade this right here from a leverage standpoint when really talking about risking one, reward is one, right? You're talking about a thousand dollar move up, a thousand dollar move down. very hard to take advantage of that now that the move has unfolded. So something to think about there. I'm not taking a leverage position at the moment, but again, no hedges, no shorts. That's crazy. This is a massively bullish and really exciting development here. I said, I think I even said yesterday, guys, the end of the light, the light, the end of the tunnel is really close. You've gone this far. Congratulations. Yes. We're going to have a couple more rocky periods. I think the fact that we did not double test or V shape a rocket out of this December low tells me that at some point, maybe over the summer, maybe if we bounce in this sort of 4,300 to 6,000 area, then maybe we get a nasty $1,500 decline, come back into the $3,000 range, maybe even test December lows. But I don't think we go below it. I just don't see how we do go below at this point. I think that's the low and that's exciting for me. Let's take a quick look at some of the open positions, see if they got smacked. This actually, if you think about, look at Cardano here, obviously taken, you know, sharply lower on the spike in Bitcoin, but these are matching, almost matching the gains in Bitcoin. So Bitcoin was up something like 20%. These alts versus the dollar are also up 15, 16%. This recovered beautifully. So I'm still along this stops all the way down here. We're not taking out, giving some room. This is good. I will look to see if I could move it maybe to that bottom of today's candle now at this point. But that looks good. I like this staying long. Qtm, same thing, got hit, didn't come near my stops. Now recovering, it seems like. I'll just leave this one again, see if I could maybe move this up in the coming hours or days or two. But for now, let it go. This, the altar performing really well, considering how strong Bitcoin is. This is good. Same thing from XMR, my position flushed all the way. Again, did not hit my stop. Come back up now. Now it's back above the breakout point. This looks good again. Even though you have this massive candle, that's excusable again because of the move in Bitcoin and the speed of that move. But the fact that this is recovered now and back above the breakout point is very positive to me. Keeping this position as well, keeping all my positions here. The one position I did lose, I noticed this morning, checking Binance. Here's my Litecoin position. This one here got flushed out, unfortunately. That's why you have stops. But this also, like the other coins, is recovering and may continue higher as well. I think this still looks good. Unfortunately, in a very fast market, when you're trading against, when the pair you're trading against or the other item in the pair is Bitcoin in this case, then you're going to get these types of wicks. So I got out right at the bottom here, right where it is now, actually, in fact. So that's three out of four. One got hit and then the rest will stay long at this point. So let's go back to Bitcoin here. Day one or day 54. So basically, either just still have to end the cycle or just starting a new cycle. Both cases are bullish because it puts in higher highs, higher lows across the board. I think that that almost confirms December low. Big positive news. Be patient, guys. You don't have to make every single trade here. I know Bitcoin's up sort of a thousand or maybe $800 right now. That's fine, right? We're long Bitcoin overall. We're exposed overall. This is really good news. Even your coins, if they're down somewhat today, they're still up against the dollar, the yen, the euro, whatever currency you are currently trading in or transacting in or getting paid in. It's up. The whole sector is up. So that's good news. And this, again, this is also a marathon. A lot of room. If we zoom out here, a lot of room to go. A lot of potential to get all the way back up. Over time, patience is going to be key. I know people are getting super excited on Twitter and everywhere else. Everyone's talking about how much money they've already made or they could make or will make. It's a process, right? So if you're a long-term holder, then this is just very, very positive news and the reason why we want it to be fully loaded. If you're a trader, then this is just another day, another move, right? Whether it's up or down, it's just another move. We'll have many, many, many of these types of moves coming in the future. And hopefully we'll be positioned for all of those to come. Thank you for the update. Of course, comments in the section below, I'll be checking throughout the day.
