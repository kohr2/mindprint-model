Good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas. it is Monday morning, July the 1st. we have a new week, a new month. wishing you all the best. this is your weekly cycles report, gonna cover mostly Bitcoin, and at the moment we see Bitcoin under some pressure here this morning at 10,600 and in a declining trend on the short term, possibly also on the intermediate time frame as well. so what we have is a clear local top here near the $14,000 area. last week, on the 26th, that was followed by a- let's take a look. I think it's around a 30% correction or close to it. yeah, around 25% lower on the. let's call it a mini crash, because Bitcoin- you know a crash in Bitcoin- would be something like 40%. so like a little mini crash here over at one trading day, it looks like, and then somewhat of recovery. but now, obviously, the 10 day, the 20 day, the moving averages are pointing lower, at least certain. the 10 day on the four bar, on the four hour chart: here they're all moving lower, looks like. we're now looking at another test of the lows that was set last week around the 10,300 to 10,600. there should be a lot of support in this area. we had this rising wedge here, this triangle- I should say ascending triangle- last week where- or two weeks ago now, when it exploded higher up to that 13,800 area, we've also seen other patterns or consolidation patterns similar to that in the past on the way up and higher. so the question now is: can it maintain this area? if it can hold this 10,300 area and not fall below it, then it could consolidate for a week or two before moving higher again. I think this is going to be a key area to hold and maintain. this could even be lost before I'm done with this video. the way this chart looks right now it is looking a little bearish or look a little scary. but again, there should be some support in this, in this, in this range. this is a four hour chart. if I move out to a daily, I think it's going to show a little better. so here we go, clear top in the cycle, the 60 day cycle. the cycle lows are not perfect here, I gotta warn you, but we do have an ebb and flow type structure here going back to February. so we do have up, pause up, pause up, pause up. so we have certainly a cycle structure moving higher and the question here is simple: are we now pausing before going higher again, which has a lot of credibility because we are looking like we want to go up and test those all-time highs very quickly in this new four-year cycle? or is is this 13-8 peak the peak for now, for the intermediate time frame, meaning that the rally, the rally that began back in February, has it ended? has it ended with a move up to 13-8? now, of course, when you look at it from a percentage standpoint, nearly 200 percent gain. I think it's more than 200 percent gain actually. then you think, of course it's got to be over by now. but again, when you get into these parabolic type moves, the market can continue and continue higher. so there's, there's really no reason why we couldn't consolidate here for a week or two and then move higher. on the same- and this, you know- the same- token, I can pretty much see why I can move down and come all the way back down into this seven thousand four hundred to eight thousand dollar area, consolidate sideways for a month or two. so, and that's because we have a parabolic structure in place and in a parabolic move you just don't know when the top comes. you just don't know, if that top comes, how much of a decline you're going to get. but you should expect, in a move like this, a 40 retracement, I think, as a well, not as a minimum, but I think you should at least acknowledge that this market will will at some point come back around 40 percent um. and do you know, it's typical shakeout and and profit-taking um event that that will always follows a move of this nature. so if you look at that, it's not that scary, though if you, if you kind of consider the fact that we had in June- so just a month that passed, we had prices in June, all this, all these candles right here starting from, uh, it goes all the way back to kind of May 16th, all the way to, just, you know, last week essentially. but a 40 decline only gets us back. okay, I mean, obviously nobody wants to go through a 40 drawdown um, and that's a almost a six thousand dollar move, but it gets us only to the candle from June 14th. so let's keep things in perspective here. we can't uh only expect parabolic right rallies and and not expect significant and sharp corrections and pullbacks in this market. but again, I'm in kind of no man's land right now in terms of what I think, from a leveraged trading standpoint, what we should be doing. I am not in a position right now, but I am. as I always mention, I am denominated across the board in bitcoin, so I have a one-to-one relationship. I'm basically in spot bitcoin if bitcoin goes up a thousand dollars and every coin I own will go up by a thousand. vice versa, if it goes down, I will be impacted. I do that because we are in a bull market. we're in a four-year cycle, so I don't want to try and compete against bitcoin directly. I just want to increase my bitcoin and that's why I hold positions in bitcoin. the only time I would either uh, get out of bitcoin or scale out is probably looking at this chart. if we get another consolidation, so let's try and draw that in for you, um, so we hold this area, come up something like this, right, and then we come up. so, if we did this, and then this move kind of gets us up to 20 000.. now that we already hit the 14 000 mark and back down to 10, you can easily see how 20 000 is just one more rally away, right, if we, um, let's take a price chart here, let's look at, uh, so this move here. this you know from where we bought up to the peak: 74 percent. that's just insane, uh. but even if we look at, say, let's just put the mid, the mid range here, let's just say we rally from here we go, 74 percent. well, you can already see we're above 20 000 of the 74 rally. we only need to do well, not only, but another 60 rally from kind of this midpoint, uh, or 60 from from the base it's, it's more than that, of course, but from uh, let's just say, the prior peak. so if we get a breakout from the prior peak around this area, then it is around about a 40, 43 rally. so we, we could be only one more consolidation and one more rally away from matching the all-time highs or exceeding the all-time highs, and for me that's in the cards. but again, it has to. we have to see bitcoin. hold this area right here, hold this 10.3. i think this bottom of the candle from last week is relevant. i think this area here, where it really started to go almost vertical, is also relevant. again. i think if it breaks below that, there's a very good chance we lose all the support, that we lose the intermediate time frame, somewhat parabolic rally on the structure and we start to come back down into this sort of seven- let's call it seven, three, two, maybe nine, one, so that kind of range in there. i think that's the flaw. i don't think we see prices ever below that level again. um, i think your worst case scenario is probably either seven, two or if we had to sort of zoom out the breakdown area back here in november at around six, three. that to me, and that's obviously more than 50 percent of a decline from the peak that we had last week, but that to me is the absolute worst case scenario and a pullback over the next, let's just say, six or five months left of the year, that is the worst case scenario as far as i'm concerned. i don't see us getting there. i think we can hold. ideally, i'd love to see us hold this area console they go up to the twenty thousand dollar area and then look for a a decline of around forty percent, or even let's just- let's just draw that out- forty percent from the twenty thousand dollar area, right? so a forty percent decline back to, say, twelve thousand, kind of where we are, where we were last week. uh, worst case, you know, maybe we get. maybe we get a half a fifty percent decline back down to ten thousand, which is where we are today. that would be the most ideal um scenario, obviously right, going up to a double, double, double top test of the all-time highs. then do a massive correction over, say, three or four months. not just one big drop, but an actual correction and then a cascading couple of 60 day cycles, maybe two, even three 60 day cycles lower kind of really suck the air out of this move in this market. let everybody talk about a double top on a grand scale um, and then a 40- 50 correction would really help to cement that narrative and then we can really build a new base back to 20 and then break out from 20 next year and then go on to some of the highs that i've been talking about now for quite some time. that's how i see this playing out. but again, watch out for the short term here. uh, don't go leveraged here. but don't also lose your spot position. um, yes, we could drop a couple thousand dollars. it's just not worth it losing your position at this point because if we do, if we do drop suddenly and then it rallies again, you may not be able to get back into spot even as well, uh, and it could continue higher very rapidly and sharply. then let's take a look at the weekly chart here, and this is what i'm talking about- this parabolic like it's not parabolic, but it is. it has a similar- um, you know- structure here in terms of just how steep it is on this weekly chart and this one candle here is a little, a little threatening. right, we did have a pretty significant move from uh three. in three weeks we went from the eight thousands to thirteen thousand. so there is a big case, or a good case here to say that this is the top of this rally that began essentially december's when it bottomed out- uh, the double, the retest in february. but really the rally started, i think, here with this accumulation zone and then this april candle, the, the awakening candle, and then it's gone up ever since. there is a good case here to be made, of course, for this, the way that it looks. but again it went rapidly significantly outside of the upper bollinger bands on the weekly chart. it's come back. now it seems like it's consolidating again. the question is, can it hold this area, consolidate sideways and then go one more time? you can see the blue line here, the all-time high. it's within reach now. uh, this candle here kind of got pretty close. so if we can consolidate here, that's it's. looking at this chart, it's pretty easy to see how, um, how bitcoin can get to 20 000 just by by maintaining that trend. so if we can consolidate in more weeks and then that's how it does it, okay, that's, that's really the opportunity here on the weekly chart as well. but then again, we've got a 10-week moving average here. right now it's at around the 8700 area. if that's lost, then, um, it's, it's over for now, right, and i think we have more of a correction over three to six months that that will occur. i think once this, once this trend ends and peaks, we will get a consolidation. in my opinion, we'll be re-accumulate in this kind of 10 000 to 15 000 range, or maybe even eight to 13 000 range, depending on where the bottom is of of of the decline coming off this intermediate trend. that bottom will form the lower boundary, excuse me, and some support, and then probably this range in this 10 to 13 000 would form the- uh, the support- sorry, the resistance- on the other end and support in the bottom, of course, um, that's, if we drop, if we go higher, then 20 000 will become the resistance for some time and maybe this, this low where we are right now, around that 11 000, will become kind of the support and we would bounce and bounce and bounce and bounce for a while into 2020 and then we can rally up a couple different scenarios here. just be patient. for now. um, let's look for opportunities. i think the next opportunity on the long side comes only if we can consolidate here for a while and then look like it's breaking high. if we consolidate here without breaking below 10.3, then i think if we can hold this for another three or four more days, then i think we are consolidating and then i get very excited about getting leverage long again to a move towards 20.. if we break lower, i don't think i want to short it personally, um, although if an opportunity arises i will- but i think what we want to do is pick up leverage positions down in this area here around about the- you know again some of the 8 000 to 8 700 area. in that area there i'd want to start accumulating some leverage positions. i think that would be a good spot to keep adding if we do break down lower from here. so okay, that's the bitcoin cycles update for this week. i'll have a top 10 market report out on wednesday. just an fyi, there is a holiday here in the us on the 4th- 4th of july. i will be taking the 5th off, the friday, taking kids camping for three days, so there won't be a lightning report or anything like that on friday, so wednesday will be the last report. leave any questions that you have below. happy to answer them and all the best.
