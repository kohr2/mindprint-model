Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Friday morning, the 29th of March here in New York. I hope you're all doing really well. I hope you're looking forward to a good weekend. Before we get there though, here is your weekly lightning report. This is the weekly segment where I pretty much go over around about 30 coins in the watch list, take a quick look at the chart and have a look to see if there's anything interesting going on or any opportunity on any one of those charts and basically give you my feedback on what I see on the chart. Now, the disclaimer here is that again, as always, I am looking at some of these charts for the first time in a week since the last report. Some I am introducing for the first time and in general, you're getting analysis pretty much on the fly so you need to take that for where it's coming from. If it's something I really like, I'll obviously point that out. If there's a position I'm in, I'll let you know. Otherwise, some of the analysis is going to be very quick and kind of dirty in some ways, right? Quick and dirty analysis that for the most part may not be relevant to you. So let's get stuck into it. Of course, we're going to start with Bitcoin and here we have day 51 of the cycle. We have not turned over as I thought we would by now. We have now made a new high for the second half of the cycle. Still have not taken out the day 18 high. So that's not overall anything significant, not all that bullish. What I mean by that is day 51 and we still haven't made a new high. So 51 days higher from the last low, almost two months and yet we can't get above day 18 high. So I think we're running out of time. We're running out of time. I have said before, if we surprise to the upside, I will not chase the move. I will rely on a cycle to come back and form a low probably above or right at that line here, which is kind of resistance or should be resistance. So if we break higher and come back down, that's where I would want to buy. I just won't chase the move. Fortunately, I mean, I'm trading futures and my positions are already essentially in Bitcoin, not kind of an excuse for not taking a rally, but just basically saying when it gets to the upside, when I'm not expecting it, it's not a huge deal for me. I just, I'm happy to let it go and just watch and look for an ideal opportunity to get back in. It's on the short side on the hedge or being short side that I really want to be taking advantage of or being a part of when it happens. So what I think it might be happening here, and I mentioned this, this probably is from the Wednesday report. I said, we should exceed the candles here, but probably not the day 18 high. I think the day 18 high stays in place, kind of get into the zone, run out of room, um, right out of, um, you know, um, buying pressure or buying support and then start to come down. The question then becomes, if we come down, where does that cycle low begin or where does it end? I should say, where does it form? Um, being that it's day 51 of the cycle, we are running shorter and shorter on days and that timing window that we have here is now pretty much upon us. There's only two days left. I've drawn the, the, I've drawn the timing window to begin on the 31st of March and kind of end around the 24th. Of course, plenty of time for Bitcoin to just slam down quickly. We know that, but still looking for and encouraged by the fact that we're holding on for so long in this cycle without a collapse that if we do, or when we do get a drop like this, that again, we're going to either double bottom off the February cycle low, or we're going to double bottom off the December low, which I think at the moment still stands as the four year cycle low. So if we can double bottom off this here, this becomes a solid $1,000 drop. It's around 20%. That's going to scare a lot of people. That's going to get the bears thinking that there's a continuation of the bear market. It's pretty much everything we need, which is pretty much a capitulation sell off into the cycle low, double bottom off the four year cycle low, and then we can move higher again. I think that's neat. It's perfect. Of course, in markets and trading, nothing is ever neat and perfect. So we need to be aware of that. Um, again, the difficulty here for me, and I think it's going to be for almost everybody is that we're trendless where, you know, we're moving sideways overall. And, um, you know, and, and those sort of trendless markets, it's difficult to get a sort of a good position established and, you know, and trading it longer or trading it for, uh, you know, for training for that trend. Cause there just, there's no trend at this point. Um, obviously you don't want to be short yet. I mean, I took one, one short, one short shot at this only I took, and that was because I saw a breakdown here and a good spot in the, in the cycle. It didn't happen. Now I'm very much patient. I want to pretty much see a swing high at top and then a confirmation that it's moving back lower before looking at another short opportunity. Okay. So that's the update for Bitcoin. Pretty similar to the update I gave on Wednesday and Monday, the difference being that we have kind of this move now deep into the cycle into this area here. Let's see how it reacts. I think a lot of people are getting a little excited here, especially the last couple of days. So I think that's going to push the long interest, meaning the amount of people that are leveraged long, uh, much higher in a more precarious position and very few shorts are active at the moment. So I think from a contrarian standpoint, we are ready and in the right position for a move lower. Again, just be mindful. If it goes higher, that's, that's a possibility at this point. So let's move on to the list of coins that we have and we normally follow. All right. So ADA has been a really nice trade for me. I have a good size position, position on this one, working out really well. Um, no real threat at this point. Every little drop seems to be, um, recovered and then rallies higher. It looks like overnight, we had another good move up to around about 1733, 1800 is my second profit target, um, to take profit on the second, third of the position, 33% already been taken. A 1800 is the 33%, second 33%. And then the rest, we ride. What I have done is moved the stop up to here. So it's right below this candle here in this wick, which is a little bit of a hammer looking candle. Uh, so that the stop is around about 1450, just below the 1480, the bottom of this 1450 gives us some room. I think anything below 1450 at this point is a danger spot. It means that's the site. The means that this chart is probably topped at this point. Why, why stay long and give up all your profits at that point. Um, the second entry was just out of this breakout. So this would be a nice profit still, uh, around about 10% on a stopout. So not bad for a stopout to get a 10% on one position and around about 30% or 40% profit in the second position. So that's where we stand on ADA overall still looks good. I mean, we still, you know, still moving higher, nice neckline breakout, but certainly this green line here is kind of where the extent of the inverse head and shoulders ends at that point, we could get a good pullback as well. So looking carefully at this, um, as always, I want to move up my stops as fast as I can. If we can get another move higher, then this comes up again and up again. That's the way I play it. I want to, um, I want to preserve my, my profit that I have in there, but give it room to breathe and to move higher as well. Arc seems to be still kind of flagging here, consolidating this move. Um, bias for me is still to the upside. I said, if you went long, this is your stop. I would almost say now, if you're long, move up your stop, make it nice and tight, slightly below 3% below kind of the bottom of the candles here that gives you some more breathing room as well. Um, but this still looks like it can, it's kind of like forming a W, um, bottom consolidation here. I think it can still move higher, but again, you don't want to be caught, um, long if it starts breaking down. So that's why I suggest something like that for a stop. Air swap also looks pretty good. Um, it's, it's kind of made new highs. It looks like since last lightning report, got some good strength. I think this is definitely a, uh, a long candidate. If you've been following this, uh, the chart looks good. Let's make the bottom of that base there, the stop point as well. Um, anything below that is not good news. Um, but still it looks like it's in an uptrend now, nice bottom here over three months or so. And now it looks like it could move considerably higher from this point. There's plenty of room in this one as well for maybe a move up to 1800. So that's good opportunity there for sure. ABC. So Bitcoin cash, not a whole lot, kind of broke out of a sort of a downtrend here, but not doing a whole lot at the moment. Um, don't really like this setup too much, so I can't recommend it at this point. Satoshi's vision, Bitcoin cash SV flatlined, not doing anything I like at all at this point. Binance coin still looking strong. Um, but it has broken. No, I wouldn't say broken, but, uh, the kind of what I was talking about this trajectory, getting ever more vertical with each move would have to kind of make it like this now. Um, so threatening to kind of break down at this point, but still above a 10 day moving average. So still valid, uh, uptrend in my opinion, still looks pretty strong. Uh, I think anything below this red line is a breakdown in that trajectory. Otherwise I think you stay long. So it does support even a kind of a move, uh, lower at this point to sort of there and then a continuation that's also possible. Obviously then the challenge then becomes that, right? So that doesn't look like a continuation of sort of this uptrend that gets ever steeper. Still, we have to respect this uptrend overall. Uh, I think really to be bullish, you want to stay above this 10 day moving average, keep the trend going. So you want to be more something like this. Um, and that kind of supports kind of gets supported better, um, at this point, but still overall uptrend stick with trends. Uh, don't go against trends, either be with a trend or be sidelined, never go against a trend. Of this nature. So it still looks good. Bits, bit shares has a similar pattern to many of the old coins kind of a rounded bottom over two or three month period. I think if the whole all coin space is still going higher than all of these types of charts will continue higher overall, that look pretty good. The question is, how do you trade something like this? There isn't a clean, um, sort of setup pattern. I think you can go long and to kind of find some spots if you like this coin, uh, or if you'll, you know, if you like following it, these are the type of charts where you just got to pick, pick your spot and stick with the trend and hope that the trend is going to continue higher at this point, but they all have all these types have similar structures. So they have to be played in a very similar way for me. I don't trade these types of, um, uh, these types of setups because they're really not a clean setup. It's not a, not like a, uh, a head and shoulders or a, some sort of triangle pattern. It's more of a rounded bottom so they can get noisy and chop you out of position as well. So I don't, don't necessarily find a tradable position here, but overall I think these, these do have a bottom potential in them. Civic coin is another one that looks kind of similar to what I just showed you on bit shares, very similar rounded bottom pattern over a few months. Looks like they want to go higher. Some of them have some big spikes like this. Again, the same type of, view here is that if alter going higher, then these will just keep going like this. If alter not going higher, of course we're going to end the top, then these will all fail. These types of patterns will all fail. So again, pick your points and pick the one you like the most. For example, you know, this one here has a little bit, a little bit more of a setup because you've got this sort of, um, consolidation, almost like a flag or pennant type pattern. So these do give you an opportunity to at least define your risk, maybe below this candle right here. So you've got, uh, kind of like a 10% drop in, uh, in, in your risk. Um, you know, your risk level, for example, whereas the other one probably didn't have that. So that's just something to look out for. I like to find little, little points on a chart that makes sense to me where if it drops below, then the patterns negated, the uptrend is no longer in play. And that's what I use for me as a stopping point. So those types of, um, those types of positions on a chart give me the opportunity to define an entry at least and define my trade size. Dash here is looking pretty good. Um, looks like it has a bottom in December, so it's got a decent looking chart pattern. Not sure if there's necessarily a trade in this, but, um, I think if you like Dash from a sort of longterm perspective, it's kind of falling off the radar lately, but if you like it, it's probably a good entry here. This looks like it may have bottomed a couple of points here that could act as sort of a stopping point. This one here would be the most conservative one. And then you could, if you want to get really aggressive on a trade, sort of get in on this sort of stop here and hope that it's kind of like consolidating, going higher, consolidating, going higher. Seems like it has that one up two up three. So that can continue going in that sort of step up fashion. That would be a stop in that case. Engine coin here. It looks like it has finally topped and now, uh, has a pretty, pretty classic looking, uh, sort of top pattern here. So you've got this big spike, good size drop, then a three quarter way move back up that fails. And then now we kind of have below this area here. So making new lows, I think this goes down, retraces probably back to this area here at some point, quite a far move lower. I think if you were trading this and you were taking, taking this long uptrend, you want to be out at this point. You don't want to be risk, um, it coming all the way back down. I have a position in this longterm. I did clean up some of it on this move higher because it just moved too far, too fast. But I do like it from a longterm standpoint still and hold on regardless of what the chart is telling me on the short term. Yeah. EOS looks pretty good here. We, um, we have this break of the neck line talked about that came back. I drew this line and I think it might've been last week talking about that would be a stop point, um, on this up trend. Looks like now we have come out of this consolidation period from this big move. Maybe that made another move. This to me looks like it's going to keep going higher at this point. So this is the type of chart I do like, even though now it might be a little stretched, maybe a little overboard. I do like kind of this con this type of chart, um, where it's just making steps higher. It's trending higher. It now has the makings of a new sort of prolonged uptrend as well. So, uh, this one here for me is a long candidate. If you like EOS, uh, stick with it. The trend is there. Here's your stop point. You may want to now move up your stop point to here. So keep moving up that stop point guys. I keep reinforcing that move up your stops, move up your stops, but make them reasonable enough. We're not getting chopped out of position unnecessarily, right? They always have to be, um, tight, but only tight where they make sense, where you're giving your setup and your pattern enough room to breathe and move higher. ETC on the other hand is not something I like. We do have a December low. We held the lows in February, but overall not doing, not doing much that I care for at this point. Um, I, this is an avoid for me. I just don't see where the trade is, unfortunately. So here's Ethereum. This one's important. Um, not doing anything at all, just chopping sideways. Um, so Bitcoin is just too much strength and this is not, this is not outperforming where normally when Bitcoin is doing well, Ethereum outperforms right now. It's just matching the performance of Bitcoin. And that's why you see this stable here. I think if Bitcoin does turn lower, this will underperform Bitcoin and therefore against, against Bitcoin, Ethereum would drop. Don't know where to, but I think maybe a test of the February lows is what I'm looking for. And then a nice move higher perhaps, but not much strength here overall, even, even though a lot of the old coins do look like to have more relative strength or holding up pretty well, Ethereum is not. So that's a little bit of my concern, uh, for the entire space in general, but this for me is not a long, not at this point. Um, I think it becomes a good long at the, at the coming cycle low for Bitcoin. Go chain is, um, well, it's starting to fall back down now. Um, if you kind of bought maybe a mini break here, um, um, considering getting out now, a 10 day moving average has turned down. Price is one, two, three, four, five days below the 10 day moving average. For me, this is now a sell at this point. So adding Grin for the first time, uh, Grin actually, I do mine this by, um, if you didn't know, I do a little bit of mining on the side, mostly just from three GPUs on a souped up, um, server that I have. Um, but I do mine gin. Uh, I like gin. Sorry. I keep saying gin. Grin. Um, I've got, I've got alcohol in my mind. Um, so Grin, um, I do like this. Uh, I think it has potential overall, um, but it has been sold off pretty significantly for quite, uh, quite some weeks, if not months could be forming a little bottom here. I don't know. It's a little early to tell, but, uh, the 10 day moving average has sort of smoothed out. It seems like it may want to form a low. I think if it can get above this line here, it has a potential for a reversal and a move higher, but at this point it's still on the watch list. H O T flattening out, um, judging by the wicks here, not a whole lot of, uh, movement or volume, still only 28 Satoshi. So yeah, this is like a penny stock, um, but good structure here. This could be sort of, well, no, this is, this could be almost a decilient triangle forming as well. Um, even though it's not clean, but this looks like it could be continuation because you've got this nice move higher. Um, key is going to be how, how, how it reacts down the bottom here. So if it breaks below this 26 level 25, get out, but if it can kind of move out and break out a little bit, this could move higher and double or triple easily from this point. This is not the type of coin I buy for example, but, um, this looks like it has, has potentially the way. So keep an eye on this one. Okay. Icon ICX. So this is one we had long a while ago and got out, and this is a perfect example of why I get out of coins that don't move. So we had nice trends up, up, up, and then it's just kind of just done nothing since now. It could still continue higher, but for me, 10 day moving average is now moving much lower prices below it in general. This to me looks like it's starting to head back lower. No reason to be long this anymore, even though, um, even though it could still, you know, move high and go again. The, the, for me, the initial reason for getting into this trade, uh, is done with, and from a new fresh perspective, I don't see it at this point as a, as a long opportunity, even though again, you've got kind of a February low, you've kind of got a base or a bottom, and this could be an uptrend. I just don't see the long trade in the short term for me. Self key again, same like last week bottom, uh, you know, just running along the bottom, not a whole lot to see here. I want to see some evidence that it wants to go higher before looking to get anything, uh, anything long this one. LISC looks decent, um, February low, no December low, but still had a bit of a breakout. It's come back down. Um, it looks like it could be sort of, you know, consolidating again before moving higher. I'm not sure if you're getting long on this one, but if you are long from earlier, then clearly this is your stop right now. Um, and you may want to start to consider moving that up pretty quickly to that point there. Um, but you may want to give a little more, a bit more room for the time being, but this looks like it could go higher, but it's a could be right. A lot of charts look like they could go higher. It's a matter of, um, will it? Um, so yep, just keep an eye on this one. If you're long, stay long. Okay. Litecoin probably the best looking chart of all huge, beautiful uptrend, moves higher consolidation moves, high consolidation. We have a running consolidation here. That's moving higher. I think even though it's sort of breaking down a little bit today, I think this is, uh, if the whole sector is still moving higher, Litecoin looks like it's going to go again. It looks like it can easily do another one of these types of moves. Okay. So let's take that and kind of put it up there. That's the type of potential it has. It did something kind of similar here. If you look at it, did something kind of similar, not so much here, but you get the point. It's looking like these consolidations, um, give way to another move higher. So that's what I'm looking at here. I'm now I'm, I'm long this, but I'm long again, uh, with a little more position based on this area here. I'm not sure if I actually put a trade alert out for that. So I'm going to check that to make sure I did. If not, then I will issue one, but essentially now we're looking at, um, here it is here, looking at this candle here as the stop. And we want to get that up fairly quickly to that bottom candle right there. So that's what I'm looking at for light coin. Mana coin. Well, hello, look at that. That's a massive spike, uh, up to the top of that channel. And you eventually would do that, but not in one day. That's just huge. That's almost a 40, 50% move. You do know, I hold this from a long-term perspective from a trade perspective. I don't see anything right now. The trade would have been down here to hold. It didn't look pretty even back then. So, uh, this for me is not an opportunity to go long from a trade standpoint. MKR, MKR, um, looks like last week I had said it was forming kind of a breakout or consolidation to break out. It did slightly break out. I said this would be a stop looking, uh, looking like it might break down to stop out now at this point. Don't necessarily like this. Uh, I wouldn't be going in long for this. Um, trend is higher overall, but don't like the fact that it's kind of tried to make a move. Now it's moving back below as well. So I'd be cautious on this. If you're still long this and then stay long, I think though, all these, but the bottom of all these candles here, which kind of have the same price, uh, 0.16, I think that is definitely a stop point, which is not too far below. OMG. Yeah. This looks really nice. Look at this uptrend. Um, just moving kind of like, as I've been outlining, just, um, you know, kind of like light coin, but on a shorter timeframe here, it's going up, consolidating, going up, consolidating. It looks like it's consolidated again. This is a, if you're long this stay long, uh, you can almost put in a new trend line kind of like this, keep it honest to their moving averages above it. Uh, anything below that is a get out, but this point stayed long. Uh, you can even get long. I'm not sure where you stop is based on this. Um, that's too far down to use this candle, but thing is it's, it's definitely moving higher with a nice solid uptrend and fairly vertical as well. So this is a good looking chart. Oh, NT is a good looking chart as well. We have a December low, nice move higher, um, stepping up, stepping up. So it looks like, so let's take a look at this. It looks like it came back here to sort of test. That's well, drop below that. That's a good shakeout right there. Came back down, uh, tested these two peaks right here, moved up, came back down. Now it looks like it's, it needs to move higher at this point. Otherwise it stalls. So this is still, if you're long, stay long. Uh, this does not become, uh, so this probably is just stopped right now, right here, this bottom wick, it reversed on that. That was a stop out. Okay. That was the shake out from the long. Now it needs to move higher. If it gets down again and gets back below that wick, then that's a top for sure. I would think, and then it moved back lower at this point though. This still looks pretty good. If it even gets closer to here, I might even buy this one. I like this looking chart. So, um, stay long and, uh, I'm going to keep this on my watch list for sure. I'm actually going to put in a alert on this one. If it drops back below that line, I will probably add, um, to my position. Let me see. Okay. Qtum. Now this one here, I've been following, I've been tracking, I've been tweeting this out. This one looks a lot like the ADA chart just weeks behind. I've talked about that quite a bit, had a big move, broke the neckline on the same day. That's just, uh, probably more speculative or spam type volume. Uh, that's to be ignored, but now we're building this base. It's kind of a retest here. Almost another retest come back down. I think once this breaks this neckline and I've got an alert set, this one here is definitely a long trade opportunity, and this one could easily move up to kind of 2000 area. So this one could easily double is what I'm saying from this point. I want to see more of a breakout first before doing that, but keep this one on your watch list, make an alert. This one is the type of trade that you should be looking to do yourself for sure. Raven coin continues to surprise parabolic like structure. Definitely thought this was a top. It's moved. Definitely thought this might've been a top. It's still going higher at this point. I don't know how to get in at this point. For me, these are just way too advanced for me to even want to get in. I think in the past, but every time I tried to get into something like this, that's exactly when it topped. Um, so I'm happy to just watch people ride this one. Uh, ultimately 10 day moving average is nice and tight. That could be a stopping point as well. I don't know what to tell you. Otherwise, you know, this is just too vertical for my liking. Um, it's just, you know, if you've, if you've, if you've been riding this, I think very few people have, if you've been able to ride this and stay long, then you'd know, you probably know better than me on how to handle your position from this point. Cause you've managed to stay long up until this point. So keep it going. Stratus not doing much kind of moving on the bottom. It did have that nice move. It did nothing. It's come all the way back down. Have an alert set. I'm not even sure if I want to do anything on that type of alert. That's just kind of let me know that it's doing something. Um, yeah, this one is not interesting to me at the moment. Theta is a, wow, that's not looking good at all. This is definitely retracing back. Definitely topped massive fake out here. Uh, false breakout came all the way back and has completely shaking people out. If you went long this and you're still holding, then I'm not sure what you're doing. You need to be out of this, uh, even though this can, can certainly reverse at any time. This is not a pretty looking chart. It looks like it has definitely topped, could be heading much lower as well. Tron looks like it wants to build it is building a base. It looks like it wants to eventually at some point kind of break out. Um, but it's not doing that yet. So, um, question is if it can get above this line, then we may be interested, right? Um, but this needs to be up a little more. Uh, otherwise there's no real trade to be had here, but it looks like it could be trying to maybe test it one more time, come back for the cycle low, and then maybe make a move higher. Vibe looks similar to many coins, kind of around the bottom. Good thing about it is it has a September low. Um, but not sure where the entry is just yet at this point. I think we want to see a move higher. Um, nothing of real significance, maybe something up here kind of, right. Um, and then sort of something like that. Keep an eye on it. Um, don't, don't like anything at this point. I just think it needs more development, more time to, uh, to get excited on this one. So if the coin has consolidated, I did talk about kind of it moving higher. This would be sort of the point where it would want to go up again. If not, it starts to break down, could go along here. You could use the candle right there as your stop point. Anything below that sort of breaks the, breaks the pattern. See how you've got this consolidation and then a move higher that could be doing the same thing right now, similar here, but a breakdown below is trouble and a reason to get out. But so overall, this looks pretty good because there is a little bit of history now of it coming out and forming and moving higher as well. So it's not in the, one of those pre pre move stages. It actually is already moving. So could respect the small trend that's developed here as well. XLM Stella don't like this. It had a nice move. It could go higher again, but I just don't like the fact that everybody's sort of selling and giving away Stella for free. So, um, I think it's kind of jumped the shark, so to speak with all the free giveaways. Don't like that. Um, and I don't like much on this chart, to be honest with you. Monero, um, still chopping sideways, looking for that next move. I think this is going to be pretty big once it moves, but the problem is it could be a continuation lower. It could also be kind of a, not normally wouldn't be, but it could be a sort of bottom reversal as well in the making. We'll just have to wait and see on this one and just keep an eye on it. I think I've been really, really right on Ripple. This is just a downtrend at some point. This sort of decline may begin to accelerate. I think coming down to kind of this bottom trend line area here is a big possibility at this point. So it's around about another 30% drop from here, but yeah, I think this can just continues down lower and then maybe you can get another move higher as well. Hard to say, but this is just very bearish overall. I know a lot of people are fans of Ripple. A lot of people are not fans of Ripple. It's love or hate for Ripple. Um, definitely not looking pretty at the moment. Tezos continues to move higher. Nice move, consolidation, moving again. This one has the potential to keep going and going and going. Um, again, not one of the ones, not, not the type of chart you can just say, I want to get long and not risk a lot. So that's where it's at the moment. Um, if we get a consolidation back again, then you can look at sort of buying maybe in some, that something that looks like this, but at the moment it's not a buy for me. XVG looks like a nothing at the moment along the bottom here. Needs to see some upside action to get remotely excited about this one. For me, does not look like a chart I want to be involved with. Similar again on ZEC or Zcash, not looking good. March lows. I want to be avoiding this. This looks like a massive continuation lower at some point. Certainly if the Bitcoin cycle breaks down, this is going to get smashed in my opinion. Horizon or Zen is one of the ones I had put an alert out for. I think the trend is still higher. Still looks decent, although it's starting to roll over a little bit. It's not really moving higher. It needs to make a move very soon in my opinion. This is a stop for sure. Needs to make a move soon. Otherwise it's going to roll over and just fizzle out. So just keep an eye on this. But if you went long on my alert, you're still up. And I think even this stop point here would be a profit. So stay long and see where it takes us. Closing out with 0x or ZRx is the symbol. Again, not a whole lot. It showed some promise. It broke above this kind of line here, which for me indicated potentially a bottom and reversal. But my problem with ZRx is it has a March low, not a February, not a December low, but a March low. So it needs to do a lot more to really convince me to get long, something like this. And I think the best case was to get back to this declining trend line and then potentially be rejected at that point and move lower. So I just want to keep an eye on this. Don't like too much about it yet. Although a little constructive with this move higher, still want to see it and continue that trend or that move higher before starting to see validation that we have a new trend or an uptrend in play. My friends, thank you very much for listening. Remember, patience is the key in trading. Don't overcommit. Don't just take any old trade because somebody on Twitter says they're buying it. Make sure that you understand why you're buying something. It's okay to go off somebody's advice or somebody's idea. Absolutely. I mean, that's what we're doing here to some extent, but they still have to make sense to you and your style. So when you see a setup, you need to be able to recognize what the person's telling you or why they're doing it. And for you to be able to think, well, yeah, that makes sense to me. I can see it. That's my style. Um, and then you kind of get to own it as well by just putting a trade on simply because somebody else is telling you, you don't know what they're thinking. You are not in their shoes. You want to know how to get out for profit. You want to know how to get out for risk to stop out or, you know, to sell out to minimize risk. You won't have the ownership you need to own and be successful to trade. So number one rule, you need to own the trade, even if it's not your idea. Okay. Um, again, any comments, put them in the, in the post below, I will answer as many as I can, as quick as I can. I check through the weekend always, I'm always answering. So if you answer, ask a question, check back in a day or two days, I will eventually get an answer on that question for you. Again, thanks for being here. Have a great weekend. All the best to you.
