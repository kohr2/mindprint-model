Good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas. it is Friday morning here in New York. this is your weekly lightning report, where I cover around about 30 odd different coins, most at the request of members. take a quick look at each of the charts. the disclaimer here is that I am trading very few of these and many of these I'm looking at for the first time or I have not looked at at all since last Friday's report. so you are getting essentially a very quick view, high level view, of the chart as I see it, with very little sort of time for analysis and study. so that's that's the disclaimer. take it for what it's worth. it's just an idea that maybe will help in your own strategy or your own setup or your own identification. that being said, we always start off with a quick update on Bitcoin being the main driver of this industry or the sector, and right now, again from a cycle timing standpoint, we're going to have to wait probably a week or two before we get some firm idea on where the cycle low will be. to me, it looks like we have this time-based consolidation here that resulted in this massive surge. looks like it wants to hold these gains at the moment. I think they would have been reversed by now. I would say looks like they want to continue to go higher. we are only still actually right now, technically, I believe we are above the Bollinger Band still, so we're still consolidating or profit taking this big move higher. it looks like it's holding pretty well, could be forming a flag here as well, and that could mean that we will once this, once this move is consolidated- and let's just take a quick look at this- this is a very crude way of determining this, but if you look at the poles here, you know wherever you put that essentially, if we get this sideways chop, let's say, if it's just like, kind of like a pennant form of some type, we could still see a pretty sizable move in more of a continuation come out of that. so, looking up towards that kind of that 58 to 6 000 level that provided a lot of support that turned, that failed into this kind of bear market lows, that would probably be the peak of this cycle when it comes- I don't know when that's going to come, but that would be the upper range. it looks like it wants to continue higher, but again, we are now kind of in this no man's land area that I talked about yesterday and during the week, and in this area here I think there's a lot more- let's just call it free air. that is going to allow Bitcoin to kind of oscillate a little more wildly and it's going to be difficult to kind of trade this area. being right here and knowing that this is probably going to be some firm resistance, there really isn't much upside here to be had and there's an equal amount of almost downside. you can almost argue that the two tops here will become support, but that's not guaranteed at all. but even if you argued- and you were right- that this was a support line now and this was now a resistance line, we're right in the middle of that. so there isn't much from a risk reward standpoint that I like in terms of getting long leveraged wise. I'm talking about at this point now from, obviously, from an investment standpoint or even from a trading standpoint. having your account in BTC is not a bad thing. you don't want to be left behind if- and it's a big if- if we get some kind of really weird strength right or ridiculous move. we just don't know, with an asset like this, you don't know if you get this right, it's a possibility. so we always want to have at least a base exposure, one-to-one exposure, to Bitcoin. we want to be, in my opinion, denominated in Bitcoin in our trading accounts. even we don't have sort of an active position, you're sitting in Bitcoin just in case you get these types of moves. ideally, I think what we're gonna see, or what I'd like to see, is more of a- and let me look at this- more of a- kind of just a gradual get up there, come back down and then form kind of a cycle low like this kind of filling in this whole area. here there's no man's land without necessarily crashing down in price. that, ideally, would be the most bullish case. this would be an early cycle low, this would be another cycle low and then that puts us firmly into a nice new trend of higher highs and higher lows at that point and putting behind us almost definitively the December lows as being the bear market lows again. this is what I see for Bitcoin. again, not much of a risk reward opportunity for for the active or leveraged traders of you out there. but again, be aware of potential upside surprises. but at the same time, you know, don't be concerned if it comes crashing back into this, into this area down here. it takes a long time to come out of the basement of a bear market, out of a crypto winter, so don't be surprised with anything coming back lower as well at this point. okay, so let's get into the lightning report. I'm sorry if I missed a coin that you requested. there was just too many out there. this report is obviously edited as well, so this takes me well over a sort of an hour and a half by the time I review each of the charts and then, you know, provide commentary and so forth. so please accept my apology in advance. it's just getting too long of a list, um, but I'll do my best to get to yours as well. so here we go. ADA cardano, very big profit winner. uh, for me and hopefully for you, two thirds out, staying one third in. I love the uptrend could see a good sizable pullback at this point. have my stop set right here. it's actually 14.50 um, but have that stop just there, because I think if it gets down to that level, we could be looking at, you know, more of a more of a move back down um and this being a really sort of being the end of this kind of move. but at the same time I want to give it some room, some good size room here, to be able to continue. higher goal is at least 2400 at this point. at 24 I might come out of the position. but uh, even that's not a huge amount of upside from here I may even be looking, uh, just holding this a little more long term. see what the see what the market can give us. but something at around the 3000 level would definitely probably get me out. that would be around about 250 profit from the entry. I think that would be enough for me at that point as well. arc has broken down. from last week I think I drew this. I said this could be a long trade. a lot of these did get hit in the short term because bitcoin did rally hard. so anything against bitcoin is going to see a lot of these charts, I believe, as I go through these. but I put in this line here for a stop and it went right through it. so this is now out, could recover. but the setup is now gone and I don't like anything about this chart from here going forward. air swap also has a similar pattern: come down on the on the on the bitcoin surge come below a line I said that we do not want to cross. this does not look. not look bullish anymore, although we do have kind of a round of bottoms to in play. this could just be a reaction and now it could set up higher again. but again, nothing clear and clean that I like about this for going forward. that is a new one added for this week. overall, I like this. this is a good, yeah, this is a very, um, okay, this is the first time I'm looking at this for the and I like the fact that we've got- uh, we've got- an actual parity here with bitcoin. even though we've got some wild swings, we do see uh, it's, it's held its value against bitcoin, whereas most coins went down sharply for the longest time. so this is very positive. we see kind of a clear cycle pattern here evolving, but we do have a breakout as well. so this is a good looking chart, I think from a lot. I don't know anything about the, the project, so take that for what it's worth, but from a chart structure standpoint, I like this a lot and I think this looks like it may be setting up for a new kind of uptrend or a new series of higher prices out of this block now that we potentially also have an altcoin bear market low behind us. I do like this one. I like it not so much from a an immediate trade opportunity, but I like it from a long-term chart perspective. bitcoin, cash, abc- well, it was only a matter of time before this rocketed higher. I knew it would just couldn't work out when it would. that's the that's obviously the challenge in trading, but this looks pretty good at the moment. now we do see the past. a lot of times we get these two, three day moves and it fails or fizzles more than anything else. I don't know if that's. this is kind of the extent of the move. it's hard to really say um, but the uptrend is in place. it's just hard to buy an uptrend at this point. if you, if you are in this or if you kind of traded that, I would just stay in this and and like we did with binance and few of the other coins, uh, in enj when they went up like this, just keep riding them, but give yourself some safe distance. probably the bottom of this bar here would be kind of your get out point. I would say maybe slightly below that how it's always tricky trading kind of a massive move like this because you want to give it room to continue higher, but at the same time, you don't want to give up too much of your profits doing that. so it's always a fine battle or balance between the two. I should say, um, in this case, you want to give it some room because I do think it's consolidating and it could go higher again. and you know this. this doesn't give it justice because this is post fork with bitcoin sv. but when you look at history before that, which is bitcoin cash, we do see- uh, we did see sort of kind of really big moves over like many weeks sometimes. so it's possible that this is going to do something like that here as well, where it just, um, you know it just kind of goes up for maybe like two or three weeks, gets to who knows where at point point one, point one, five. you just don't know where exactly. so if you're on this trend, stay with it is the point. bitcoin sv: um, of course, I don't like anything about this project but- and it doesn't really have much of a price history to go on really tight, kind of just down trending, not doing much. this one has the potential- you would think right, and all these do, but this one has the potential as well to give us a good pump at some point. problem is, how do you position yourself for that? I don't see how you can and therefore it's not something I'm interested in. but, um, you know, I wouldn't be surprised one day if we see, just, you know this kind of just do that as well. okay, um, because this is fairly, fairly cheap, I guess. um, anything below kind of 0.05 or five percent of bitcoin. it has a potential to get up there, at least in the short term. um, based on the characters involved with this project finance coin, I think the uptrend is still in play- obviously got hit with bitcoin going up so sharply, still at a reasonable point, I think, this last week. this is where last week's kind of stop point, still above that point, although we kind of seem to be rolling, uh, rounding over. uh, I wouldn't say rolling over, but sort of definitely forming around the top top, but overall, you know the. so the trajectory or that sort of parabolic trend line has kind of been broken at this point. um, nothing nasty though and explainable because of that bitcoin surge. I think this can still recover and continue higher at this point. I think if you were trading it, give it some more, give it more patience and more room, uh, but keep kind of this line here, I think, as your stopping point, because anything kind of below that would really change or alter the dynamics of this chart and I think if you got below that line it would look more more like a topping pattern is in play. um right if it broke down below that. um right if it broke down below that. so I think, sort of maintaining and staying above that low there is important for the structure of this chart to continue. higher. bit shares looks pretty good. December lows rounded bottom. uh got hit, obviously, like everything else did, but still still moving higher, higher. I like this if you're long, this or could be a long-term position. I think this chart looks really nice and I would stick with it for sure. civic coin was doing really well and then got slammed by that bitcoin move down 15- 20 percent. if you had the stop below that point, you got stopped out. unfortunately, that's just the way trading goes. sometimes we, uh we have stops. for that reason, this could conceivably start to recover again and continue that trend higher and I wouldn't be surprised if it did that. but again, now that, now that the chart is busted for the short term, it's hard to get back in. if you're a long-term believer in the project, if it's more of an investment, then I can see this is a good spot to get back in, but if you're trading, I don't see the opportunity to do anything at this point. however, dash is a good looking chart. we had the good move lower with bitcoin the other day, but this seems to now be stepping up so we can start to consider sort of a new trend going up. at that point, kind of what litecoin did starting back in december, dash could be beginning to sort of form that new level. we could be looking at sort of another step right here. I think, if you like- I know a lot of people like dash from a long-term standpoint- I would be long. if you do like it, for sure, even from a trading standpoint, you can try and find a spot where it comes back towards this 10-day moving average here, like you see here, and then pick your spot and then get in and then ride the next wave higher. I do like it. I think this has, you know, a december low as well, where we see a lot of the altcoins finding, finding a low and then stepping up since then. so you've even got another step right here. so we're looking at sort of four steps. you've got higher highs as well. so this is a nice looking chart and something you, if you're an intermediate type type trader or an investor, you can still get in long here. give yourself a smaller position, maybe even a wider stop, even use this one here as your stop, for example, which is considerably lower, but then obviously you'd have a smaller position and then let yourself kind of- let it kind of come up and into this sort of um 34 000- 38 000 range, uh to to compensate for that. so wider stop, longer profit target: that's one way to potentially trade this or invest in this as well. ENJ engine coin is one of my long-term holdings. I think it's coming back to earth now. talked about that before. I'm still holding half of my initial position, took half profit somewhere up here, coming where it was exactly now, but this looks like it's coming back down, probably going to retrace the majority of this move. often, often, coins would do that or assets would do that. so I wouldn't be surprised if it gets down to this level. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets down to the original breakout point. so there's no trade to be had here in my opinion. um, this is something you want to be avoiding at this time until this downtrend settles and forms a new bottom EOS. I, like I am. I have a long-term position in EOS. uh, this looks like it's a well, not looks like it is a new uptrend. we've kind of broken a inverse head and shoulders. we have a December low stepping higher. this is definitely a coin I think you want to have exposure to. I'm not saying or even believe it's going to sort of beat out Ethereum for the next sort of in the next phase, but it's going to be a contender and it certainly has a lot of interests and it has a lot of room on the chart to move higher as well. so EOS is something I like and I think people should have a long-term position in for sure. I like the chart of ETC Ethereum Classic. I think the project is a waste of time, but, um, we hit a trade and this could pull back a little bit, but to me this looks like we could be at least heading back to this sort of cluster here, where it really broke down in October November. we do have a breakout, a similar chart pattern to to many, many of the other cryptos. uh, Monero, for example, has something similar, but this has moved up and I think it can continue higher. but cool could also easily pull back to the sort of 10 and 20 day moving average as it goes higher. so pick, pick your spots on this one. it looks like the trend is now up, so that's that's the first good sign. the theorem to Bitcoin is surprisingly not doing much. um, obviously, against the dollar it's done okay, but this against Bitcoin is underperforming. um, not sure what to make of that, whether this is more about Ethereum and development issues that they're having scaling and so forth, or if this is a sort of precursor to kind of an altcoin. uh, shake out, this could be coming up as well. both kind of have valid ideas. um, right now I want to sort of think it's. I'm still pulling back, but the- the February lows probably will provide enough support to keep it from going lower, something we want to pay attention to for sure. when you look at it versus the dollar, though, it has underperformed. if you think about now. it is kind of exceeding, uh, the February and January highs that we have, so it's kind of trying to make a higher high. uh, we can remove this from last week. it's outperformed the dollar, but everything has outperformed the dollar as Bitcoin has rallied. uh, you would have thought Ethereum, um, Ethereum would have done something kind of like this, um, already, like Litecoin has and others, so a little concerned about what, what this is telling us or what this could be telling us or what it's doing right now, but at the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if it does break out sharply and then makes another good move. uh, from here could also look at this from, uh, kind of like an ascending triangle, although not very clean. but, uh, we do have a lower low here, um, and not really not so much here as a touch point, but we have a couple touch points at the top here, similar structure to many of the other charts. so if we do get a breakout, we could probably get like a 60- 80 move as well. Ethereum can and does surprise us often like that, and if it has formed the bottom, like I think they all have, then we could eventually, uh, this could eventually be kind of a lager and make up room very rapidly and get to this zone here and let's just take a look at what that might be. so kind of in the uh 180 to 230 range is is possible. I think that would be the resistance in the next move. but getting up into that box, if it can get moving, is a possibility for sure. nothing I like about go. not enough history here. don't see a trade set up. um, overall it's flat. so nothing, nothing unfortunate here that I could add any value to you with. Grin had a little move higher, but now it's moving back down. overall the chart looks very grim. so Grin is grim at the moment. um not seeing anything to change my mind. definitely caution on um hollow here. um looks like it could be breaking down. I would definitely avoid this one. uh, only 26 satoshi, so this must be one of these. um all coins. uh, penny stock. all coin types. this looks like it's breaking down. so nothing to report here. ICX holding up icon. um looks like a around the bottom February low could go either way. I think I want to see another move higher. the bollinger bands are getting tight so this could move higher at this point. uh, different levels that we have. I think we want to see at least a move above here before looking at this again. but I will add an alert on this one: getting above that might be an opportunity because of how tight the bands are here as well and has some good consolidation and looks like around the bottom as well, so this could move higher if it gets above that point. self key looks horrible. doing nothing breaking down. I would avoid this. one. length looks pretty good. um, although it could be- could be breaking down at this point. you kind of want to be careful at that level there. but if you zoom kind of out, this has a nice uptrend in play. um, oh, look at this. this is actually outperformed. in 2000- 2018- you had this move, but since- since- since November- um, it really has put in a nice new uptrend here. this is a seller looking chart, so this is a definitely a long-term buy. in my opinion. this chart looks like it could be a leader in any, any new move in the l coin space, so I like this one as well, and this one could be a buy in this area here and then give it some kind of give it some room as well. so I definitely like chain link. LISC is also another one I like, um, not so much from a project standpoint but from a chart standpoint. although it doesn't have a December low, has a February low, it looks like it is forming a new uptrend. a couple of points here. you want to watch for. you want to. if you want to go long, you're going to want to find your spots, kind of just pop below a spot I drew last week here. here's another low here, but this looks like it could be a new sold uptrend, something, uh, for long-term holders to be aware of. that. this is, this is now a nice uptrend. you want to give it enough space, enough room to rally higher and move higher. at that point, from a trading standpoint, don't see much in the short term as an opportunity, um, but definitely stick with this for people that, like the project, Litecoin continues to impress, continue to make the moves higher. uh called this correctly. unfortunately, the surge in Bitcoin for a brief moment there just knocked, uh, knocked the position out and then rallied higher. such as life and such as trading, we move on. uh would have been a really nice 15, 20 move already from this point, but not to be. but I still, overall, love this chart. I think Litecoin can continue moving higher. I think we will, though, at some point, get another consolidation. it seems like this- um, this percentage move is similar to this one and this one and this one. therefore, I I would suggest that we're going to get a move back lower, consolidate the gains and then we can go higher again. certainly, Litecoin, from a longer term perspective, is one that you want to have exposure to, even though it is up to kind of 90 already off a 20 move. Litecoin is the type of coin that you don't necessarily want to look at the the prior price move and say, oh, it's gone already, because it does does it does ridiculous moves. now again, it'll probably pull back at some point, maybe even back to the 70 dollar range, which would be a definite buy, but considering it's gone as high as 400 in the past- I think it was- it still has plenty of room to go as well. so don't discount or undervalue Litecoin. it certainly has a very high beta to Bitcoin. a meta coin has come back down to earth. I like this one from a long term. I have a long term position in this, but had this huge run and come back down, no trade to be had here. it doesn't look like it. looks like it's stuck in this trading range and probably will be for a while. so avoid. from a trading standpoint, MKR had some good looking charts, but now it looks like it's breaking down. so this is an avoid for me. if you're a long term holder or want to be a long term holder, you may be able to pick up a good price if you're patient somewhere down here. I would think in an uptrend, this level here will act as support. so there's it's pretty close to that, but there's some room still lower at this point. maybe another 10%, if not more, if you're. so again, if you're a long term believer or holder, getting in even some position now, but getting in down this area, I think, would be probably a good long term buy for you as well. from a trading standpoint, I don't see anything I like. hey, OMG is really working out kind of how I thought. I think I drew this chart trend line in many weeks ago and look at that. it's just up consolidation, up consolidation. a little further back than you would think, but that's probably expected considering bitcoin's move. let's bounce right back up. so this one I like. I think this one has good long term potential. if you like this project. this is a nice looking chart, new uptrend. pick your right spots and get in definitely. I would recommend this one for sure. ONT looks interesting. it did break up. it's held that area quite quite well. I think this is consolidating. it might, might, chop a little more sideways at this point. get the bollinger bands. why do I always pick the wrong tool? okay, chop sideways, bollinger bands tight and then come up again. so I think this one looks pretty good. I'm going to actually take this and move it up to around about there. give me a warning if it does break out, and then that could be a stop. this would be your target for the next move. so keeping an eye on this. I like this structure. if you're long, this from an investment standpoint: stay long. good looking chart. looks like a definitive bottom here, so overall looks pretty positive to me. Qtum had a run here the other day, took me out of my position, so I'm out of this one from a trading standpoint, not as in love with it as I was. it didn't hasn't really broken out yet, but I think if it does break out from here, we we want to take another look at this one as well and see what it can give us. so I'm going to take the initial kind of alert bar and give me kind of a heads up if we can get back kind of back above this level here. okay. so that would be kind of on my watch list at this point. but this uh, significant volume, uh slam down, uh, manipulation- I'm not sure what exactly um happens in in these altcoins. we just have to live with it. so, um, I think, just keeping an eye on this at the moment, I think overall it still looks decent. uh, it looks like it has a head and shoulders bottom in place. so I do like the potential for this to break out. if it does break out, it has a lot of really what I do like about this. if it breaks out, it has a lot of upside room because you've got this big move lower that could over time be retraced uh all the way back up, you know sort of in a stepping up fashion, all the way up to sort of you know 2000 area. so it's a good uh double or triple from this point if it can start to get into a new uptrend. RLC was a request from somebody. this, uh, overall, looks pretty good. looks like it has, uh, quite a few long, long wicks suggesting this color of volatility in this, although very little volume, but overall this does have kind of an august bottom as well, double bottom retest December. so this looks pretty good. I don't know anything about the project. I don't even know what the name is. all I know is R symbol, RLC. so I'm giving you a pure chart view only, but I do like the fact that we have this big round of bottom and now looks like we have a nice, uh sort of uptrend developing and forming here. so, um, if you like the project and you're invested, this looks like a nice trend for you to ride the Raven coin. um, so this one looks like now it actually may have topped. finally, what a beautiful run that was. I would want to say that these two peaks here I'm gonna- I'm gonna estimate, uh, the top- sorry, the- the support now for Raven coin. I think this has found a new sort of bottom and drawing this out here, I would be a buyer. if you're a long-term investor, I would be loading up a little more in this area. I think this is going to provide some support if it- and I think it will get down to this zone, uh, maybe even breach it a little bit, but I think these two kind of points here are going to be important, and you know, as we, as we move forward in the next bull market, I think it comes down here and then it starts to make another move higher. so this is important. I don't see anything from a trading standpoint in the short term, though, but long term, guys, watch this area and then buy it in that zone, if you like it. moving on to stratus here, still trending sideways, looks like it has a very, very wide bottom base here, but um, not showing a whole lot besides what it did here back in December to convince me that the bottom is definitely in on this one. I mean, I want to say it is because most of the old coin space seems to have bottoms in place, but it still needs to break out. we'll probably take some action if we can get a move above this uh alert that I have set, um, but until that happens, I don't see anything that we're going to do at this point. so I'm just going to set this alert right there and just see what happens. theta here has really broken down. I was looking at sort of a, a retest, maybe like a like a handle. here still looks like a cup and a handle, although I mean cup and handles typically are continuation patterns. you need a lot of history for those. I don't know how far back this coin um, in terms of trading history goes, but does look like a big bottom. could be just sort of like a like a handle pull back before going up. but I don't trust this pattern. I don't like this chart overall. don't hate it but don't love it. certainly not a trading opportunity from what I can see. Tron is a chart that I do like. uh, still looks like a very, very sort of big uh inverse head and shoulders. a couple of different uh sort of lows here. that one's really not a low, so kind of like forms forming: one low here, one shoulder, one here, uh, December or November lows. uh, this looks pretty good. I think if it can break out of this line- I haven't allowed cert, that would be a buy. then there's room, a lot of room higher for maybe getting up to kind of this 0.06, 0.07 area up here, uh, with little resistance, uh, or at least little resistance to, let's say, the 0.04 area, which is more almost a double uh or 50 move actually kind of all over the place here. almost a 50 move from kind of a breakout point around 0.03 could get to 0.04 fairly quickly and then from there potentially all the way up to 0.06 and 7 at that point. so this could be a long-term hold at one point if we can get above this area. I think, if you like this from a long-term perspective, you want to kind of want to be buying it here and and expecting at least that this is going to start to move and break up and then move higher over a long period does look like a nice bottoming pattern overall. so I do like this chart. the vibe is not doing a whole lot here. looked like it was gonna kind of start to move higher but it hasn't really done that, still trending fairly sideways. what I do like about this: we have a September low, so it made it low a long time ago. but I think to get excited about something like this you really want to see, uh, at least a break of kind of that line there. uh, that at least puts it into. you know, a new uh continue, I guess. uh, yeah, this puts it into maybe a new uptrend or, you know, a break of this consolidation that's. that's pretty much six or seven months wide at the moment and then could get us up into this other range here and then from there there's plenty of sky and room higher. so, at this point it's just a hold. don't really see a trading opportunity. I'm not even sure if I want to be long at this point. if I like it long term, I'd want to see some evidence that's starting to move higher and it has some momentum behind it. VTC was looking good, looked like it was moving higher. now, granted, it did get slammed, like a lot of them did, with bitcoin moving fast. but, uh, I want to see this kind of what I want to see. I I would not be trading this long. I don't know if I want to be long. um, from a longer term standpoint as well, kind of want to see it get back above this line here to re-establish this uptrend. plenty of room high on this one. I know this one got slammed, uh, considerably. so plenty of room higher to go, but I think it was. I think you want to see this at least recapture the 10-day moving average. you want to see the 10-day and 20-day moving average pointing back up and moving higher and price to be above that before wanting to get long this again as well. so right now, definitely an avoid as far as I'm concerned. had a request for wax. this one is not doing a whole lot, kind of in the, in the basement as well, similar to some of them that haven't really moved yet. don't like getting into positions just just for the argument of saying that these will eventually move as well, want to see confirmation of a move, and this is sort of right at the bottom here. if it can move higher and let's just say get above recent highs, then what's it? it's a potential to look at as well. so I'll add an alert on that just to see if we can get back above. uh, oh, I might have alerts. okay, so 10, I think I have around 30.. uh, no, thanks. so let's just keep an eye on this one. I think if it want to get, let's just say 1700, get above 1700. you want to? um, you want to be going long perhaps, and then that could mean that we'll get above this point here and then we have a nice sort of bowl forming and then we can get back up and make some considerable ground on this one. for now, it's just a watch. keep it on the watch list. XLM's not doing a whole lot. had some, had a little move here, but hasn't done much sense. I don't like this overall. this chart is not looking good. everything's moving really well and it's funny because this had a very, very good bear market move where it really kept in touch with bitcoin the entire way, but since then has really underperformed. I don't like anything underperforming, especially when the entire market is moving higher. this one is moving lower, so I want to avoid this and I have no interest in this at all. at the moment. XMR was promising. this is a long term and a short term trade position that I have going on right near the stop again. but come back up, um, seeing if we can recover here, looking for this recovery and maybe continue higher. I do like this. I like it. I don't like the short term chart. I don't like the fact it came back so sharply, but I want to give it a chance to see if it can come back up and move higher. at this point, maybe a little bias on this one, because I do like it long term. so it's hard to say, but I think it has potential here. I think it can move higher again. XRP- Ripple continues this really long downtrend. since altcoins kind of bottomed in December, this has just moved lower and lower. this will definitely have its day, you know it will, but I think at the moment we still have some more unresolved price action to the downside to go looks like that. that downside action is accelerating here, mostly because bitcoin has outperformed as opposed to ripple- underperformed, I would think. but this looks like it could move lower. getting down to this level would probably interest me if we can see some type of sign of a reversal in turn. I'd be looking at going long, something like this, but for the time being it's a watch. I think. eventually see this move here, eventually you'll get something like that. so just a matter of where it sort of settles and ends before moving higher again. Tezos coming back to to earth here, but still only back to the 10-day moving average. so overall still could be in this uptrend. I would say: stick with the uptrend if you're long. I will use this little cluster here, as this is the last real low that we see. this is your get out point. anything below that is definitely a declining, a decline. but this point we still could be looking higher. want to reverse at this point though you had this bitcoin surge, pull this down, stabilize. kind of a green red, a green hammer here could be going higher. I think if this gets reversed, even if this low of today gets taken out, probably an end to this move higher. but right now as it stands, the structure still still okay and still is moving higher. but keep an eye on that. overall, XVG not loving this looks similar to kind of some ones that haven't made a move yet, although we do have a real tightening on the bands here could move, could make a nice move higher, but I don't want to be positioned waiting for such moves. but if you know, if you're trading this, this is something to watch out for. I think any kind of sharp move from here could really move rapidly up, but at the same time, tight Bollinger bands can can be a move lower right, and it's not like we have an established uptrend yet on this one as well, even though we have a December low, we don't have a sort of a nice upside break to kind of confirm the lows. so this is still a watch and be aware the Zcash not doing a whole lot seemed to made it made a bit of a move recently. but again I don't like the fact that we have March lows relative under performance overall to bitcoin, even under performance to XMR, which is kind of its peer companion in the privacy coin space. so for me, I want to just be avoiding this at the moment, not saying it can't move higher. probably will if the whole space moves higher, but it's not showing me strength. so I don't want to be. don't be trying to trade the, the laggards here. I want to be. I want to be trading the other ones that are more stronger than the rest of them. uh, Zend has broken down. this is one that I recommended a while ago. I know a lot of people jumped on this. you would have been out on my last week's recommendation to to raise the stop at this point, but now it looks like it hasn't recovered from that. bitcoin surge could be a top, short-term top here could be coming all the way back down. at the moment it is oversold, so it could bounce, but I don't like the fact that it hasn't pulled back and come back towards recent highs quickly enough and that it's lagging at that point. that's a sign of trouble. so be aware of that. if you're still long this, I would be really, really cautious and I'd be I'd be cautious about giving back a lot of the profits that you should be in at this point. uh, take your profits and run and move on. and then ZRX: this one is a long-term hold again for me, but short-term trading wise. it got rejected here and it has not recovered. I thought that would get a move at least back to kind of this declining trend line and then more of a base. so this one has not really shown us any sign, which is a little concerning. I would have thought that this one would have moved out by now. if you know, if the alts have bottomed and they're showing a lot of promise, this one should have shown promise. I'm a little concerned about that, even from my long-term holding. um, I think it will catch a bit eventually, but I'm just again, I'm a little worried that it hasn't moved. so, from a trading standpoint, nothing to have here. and then from a long-term perspective, yeah, there's some, probably some- good value here. but I'm again a little concerned why it hasn't made that move. I would probably wait for an eventual- if it does break out of this trend line for getting long on a long-term basis as well. okay, my friends, closing up here, a couple of points. one, bitcoin, sorry, uh, market cap, total crypto market cap excluding btc. so this is basically everything but bitcoin looking like a bottom. december lows are in. um, this is a very bullish and positive chart for us all, but just be aware that a lot of them have already made some moves. we could see a a nice little pullback in the short term, um and that, and we're seeing some signs of weakness in some of the charts. overall, it's moving higher, but just be aware you could get a pullback at any time to the breakout point and then move higher, meaning that, um, if you look at this kind of move here, I guess that's 80 billion back down to 60 billion, 20 move if all most of these alts could move down- 20 a shakeout and then move higher. so be aware of that. I think, in general, um, everyone's made some good gains in a lot of different alt coins, uh, excluding maybe some stopouts this last week when bitcoin surged, but in general, it's been a good couple of months. I know my sort of binance account has done really well, um, but just be aware that it doesn't mean it continues forever. you've got to find your opportunities. do not um. if you have some long term, you have your long-term positions. do not try and trade wiggles like this. you stay long and stay invested. but, from a trading standpoint, just be aware that some of these sellers may begin to fail and that you want to have your stops nice and tight and playing towards the setup that you have identified in terms of risk as well, so you don't want to be sort of caught thinking, well, the market will correct me, I'll just stay in a position. you may get caught in something like this and and forced to liquidate near the bottom here as well, again, does not apply to your long-term position. and then again, just covering bitcoin, it kind of in no man's land, not much of a- uh, an opportunity risk reward wise for me. from a trading standpoint, I remain fully loaded from a long-term perspective and like the fact that we we probably have December lows in place. this is- this is your weekly lightning report. I hope you enjoyed it. a lot to cover here. it's been a long, long morning covering this, this report. hopefully you'll have a great weekend. please provide any questions you have. I'll obviously answer them throughout the weekend and then I'll be back on Monday with a full cycles update covering the daily and weekly Bitcoin market. thanks very much. all the best, wishing you a great week you.
