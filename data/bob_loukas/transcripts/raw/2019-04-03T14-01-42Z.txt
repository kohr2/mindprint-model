Hello Fintech members, it's Bob Lucas. It is Wednesday morning around 9.45 a.m. in New York. I hope you're doing really well. This is your midweek update. Looking at gold to begin with. So I'm looking at kind of a kind of a flag here. I wouldn't call it a bear flag but certainly is some consolidation coming off the three or four day decline. This for me won't reverse higher. It doesn't have the sort of the makings of a reversal higher. It also doesn't have the makings of a daily cycle low from what I can tell. Even though we are already up to around day 17 or 18, I think now we're going to see a breakdown of the support line here. Let's call it the neckline. I'm not necessarily saying this is a head and shoulders pattern but this is fairly typical looking daily cycle structure towards the end of an investor cycle. So now I think we're looking at that final section, final decline in the ICL somewhere kind of in this box. Price wise we don't know. I'm not expecting much of a drop, got to be honest with you. Just because it's held up for so long, we're at week 33, very extended investor cycle. I think gold is acting superbly well at the moment. Also considering the equity market's almost near all-time highs again. Gold's holding up extremely well for that reason. I think any decline we get is going to be fairly mild. But again, ICL declines can always surprise. They can go on for longer and deeper than we expect. So keep that in the back of your mind. I do think we're going to pierce the downside of this maybe today, maybe by the end of the week, I think more likely. And once we do, we'll have an absolute confirmed failure on a daily cycle level. We will take out this cycle low back in March. That will obviously confirm that we're now finally moving into the final ICL decline. And that sets the scene for a more lasting low and then perhaps a continuation of this really nice uptrend that we're starting to see over the last sort of four or five months. This is the encouraging news. So we just need to get through this decline first. I suspect that just zooming out, we will at least test this support line using the last, or sorry, the three daily cycles from earlier in the investor cycle. I'm not sure if it holds a lot of weight necessarily from a trend standpoint, but that is probably the minimum target that I would draw. So around about 1260, it's only around a $30 drop from here, which is nothing for gold. But I wouldn't be surprised if we actually get some more declines as well, just based on the fact that ICLs do tend to drop much more than we expect. And the fact that we haven't really had much of a decline yet. The peak here is around the 1340 area. We're only down $50. And for a 33 week rally, down $50 or down even down to this point, we'll be down $80 from the top, not a whole lot. So let's expect some more downside as well. I think any upside surprise here is a new investor cycle. I've talked about that before, but I think we would want to at least see a move back above the highs of this daily cycle, which is a confirmed, no question, no questions asked daily cycle top here. There's no other interpretation for this here. There's a couple of interpretations for the low, but this here is pretty much the high. So any move above that at this point is pretty much negating the downtrend that we're seeing and is a new investor cycle that we want to buy because it would be a significant surprise to the overall structure that we're seeing. On the weekly chart for gold, now we're finally starting to see a little more downside action here that's starting to fill in and complete the potential ICL. I talked last week and the week before in the weekly report, how we just didn't have any of the types of sell-off indicators or any levels of indicators to even remotely assume that we have an ICL in place. I think now this is starting to really break down the way we want to see it. The 10-week moving average almost always turns lower for some point during an ICL decline. We're now seeing that we have a second week below the 10-week moving average. If I enable the Bollinger Bands, we're probably going to see. Okay, so we've got quite a bit of room left, but at least we're popping down towards the 20 average there. I think we'll get below that and then we may even see at the worst case, like we do very often in ICL decline, see how we come down and sort of touch or even test the lower Bollinger Bands. In a very bullish market, you come close to doing that, maybe not even touching, but still there's a lot of room here and that's why I want to see some of this field before we can move higher again. Stocks continue to impress. We are around day 18, I believe it is. Could be looking for somewhat of a little peak here at this point, then come back down to a half cycle low and then perhaps rally again. We are getting really close to all-time highs again, not too far away and I didn't really expect we would even test, let alone come close to exceeding the highs in this investor cycle, the all-time highs in this investor cycle. So it's not out of the question, it would be an impressive feat to be able to come back and now take out all-time highs. I think it's going to stall before that point. I think we may come up and test it a few times, something like this half cycle low, right? DCL and then maybe come back down. That means that kind of the bears will get really excited that we have this massive double top in place even though they've been talking about sort of, you know, three-quarter retracements and then reversals. We'll be talking about head and shoulders patterns as well as a top. They will use any narrative to support being very bearish. At this point, evidence suggests that we are in a bull trend still and we've had this massive correction that could, that is fueling this move and it's just too early to say that this is over. Now, obviously, there's a lot of negative, what appears to be on a frequent basis, a lot of negative news out there, but again, news does not drive the overall market. We need to see a breakdown in price and at this point, you know, anything above this daily cycle low is bull territory. There's no reason to be bearish longer term unless we get below this level and then we can start to think about that and from a trade standpoint, yeah, there's a potential to maybe short in the latter part of this second daily cycle if it gets up towards maybe testing all-time highs, but now there's just no shorts here. Don't even try it. Waste of money. Probably should have been long here during earlier in the week. I think it's too late now. There's just not enough reward here for the level I would need to place my stop at for the risk. So just staying away from that for the time being and just paying attention more than anything else. But overall, you know, this is encouraging. It's positive six-month highs. What more can you ask for? Respect the price and stay out of the way or trade long. Very similar action in crude. I feel bad that I didn't take advantage of this. I pretty much called it out the last couple of weeks. I was looking really good during the week. I was just looking for one more pullback to go long, but instead it's now gone up pretty much around about five or six percent. It's quite a bit. I think it can continue going higher. Once crude gets into these sort of moods and rides up a bollinger bands, they can go on for longer. But now getting close to some of my targets, $63, $64 area. Hard to take a position now after it's moved up from $58, $59 late last week. But still encouraging news. The cot report still looks pretty good. It's fairly neutral at the moment. So I think pullbacks here may be an opportunity to get long. Okay. But crude overall still looks pretty good, like the equity markets do. And then lastly, the dollar, we could have another one of these tops. So it could have come a little earlier. Maybe I could just move these over a little bit. Something like this. You know, it's been a seesaw swinging action. Very consistent though, from the dollar up, down, up, down, up, down, up, probably down, probably up. And then looking for the big ICL in kind of May, I think at this point, still relatively early in the, well, not relatively early, but not late in the weekly cycle yet to, to worry about a top. Sorry. That means late in the weekly cycle to worry about it going higher at this point. I'm pretty sure that the top is in place. We had this brief cycle failure right here. I think we have top right here coming close to testing, and now we're going to start heading out and into that declining phase on the weekly chart, kind of see it here getting tighter and tighter. This is a bullish pattern. In my opinion, this is what worries me about gold in the longer term. But now we have, I think we have this top in place. And I think we start to sort of chop in here, maybe, maybe get down below the triangle very briefly, but wouldn't be surprised if this provides some good support because we do have four or five touches on this bottom line here. So maybe coming down and touching it here and then coming back up is a possibility for sure. Okay. So that's the update, midweek update for this week of the Financial Tap. I hope you're all doing really well, having a great week. The full report will come out on Sunday. All the best to you.
