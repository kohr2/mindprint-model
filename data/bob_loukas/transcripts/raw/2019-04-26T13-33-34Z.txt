Good morning Bitcoin Live members. that's Bob Lucas, Friday morning in New York. I hope you're doing really well, looking forward to the weekend. so here is the newly new format for the lightning report. this week I'm not going to go over 30 odd coins where I think most of you are not really paying attention to some of the most of these coins. the format has changed as of Wednesday. Wednesday becomes a top 10 market cap report- all the top 10 coins reviewed in a little more detail, both short term and long term. then the Friday's report becomes the top 10 altcoins requested by you, the members. that way, I'm only covering coins that I know people are interested in or requested, and that will be done via the comments on the Wednesday's top 10 report. you can then put in a request for the Friday report and, by the looks of it, there were six requests for different coins I'm going to cover today. so I'm going to cover six of those coins. I'm also going to cover Bitcoin, as I always do, and then I'm going to look through my list, see if there's anything else I find of interest that you may want to put on your own watch list. so let's go into Bitcoin. all right, so we had some pretty significant tether news from the New York Attorney General suing, or you know- basically stating that Bitfinex used a whole lot of tether reserves to cover losses that they had in the Bitfinex exchange. not, they're not suggesting this time that they are creating tether out of thin air or that it's not backed, but that they used funds essentially from tether to cover losses. so, in the end, probably not the most horrible news, I guess, and also, at the moment, still something that Bitfinex is going to reply to and it's not substantiated at this point. so, regardless of what happened, it did cause a 10% decline in Bitcoin. I'm not sure if that news warranted such a decline. to be honest with you, I think what we have more here is we had a tightening of the Bollinger Bands, we had a lot less volatility and then the news driven event expanded that and created a cascading effect of declines. now I did warn in an alert yesterday that we could be looking at the daily cycle top or the 60 day cycle top for this. for Bitcoin, it is possible that would be around about day 30 high. not too bad, considering we've been seeing shorter highs- 18 and 9 and 27. we haven't had a 19. let's go back day 30 high. last time we had one in a cycle was back in July. so even even if it topped right here- probably not the end of the world, probably still looking at a retracement in that case- sort of down like that right and into the next cycle low end of May- that's not too bad, that's. that's within my expectation, still. so this is the. this is kind of- I wouldn't call the primary thesis that I have right now for where Bitcoin stands, but something to certainly be aware of, because we are below the 10 day moving average and the 20 day moving average, and whenever that happens around the midpoint or the latter half of a cycle, you really need to be careful and consider the fact that it may have topped already now. that being said, let's see how it responds over the next two days in the weekend. if it bounces back from this point and rallies back over the 10 and 20 day moving average- let's just say back of 53.50, for example- then you know we could be looking at another leg higher, and that would be very bullish. I think that would be very bull market like behavior as well, so let's just look out for that. at this point, though, there's no point in trying to front run or trying to trade any one of these scenarios because it is kind of 50: 50 right. so if we get back above, we could do this one more high around early May, get up to that sort of 5800 area I've been talking about for a while, which is the resistance, which was the support, but which should become resistance from the bear market 2018 period and then come back down. in this case, similar type of action. I expect it'll come back down into this May cycle: low, maybe a little higher because it's higher, coming from a higher spot. hard to say, but in the in the end, kind of the same net result that I'm looking for, regardless of what we're doing here in the short term. so that's kind of how I see this market at the moment. there always is the possibility that we even get even steeper. of course, just be aware of this. again, it doesn't really matter hodlers, long-term guys, we have our positions right, we're set at this point. that doesn't worry us. we just we can maybe buy some more. if it gets down to that area traders, then if it breaks down sharply, if it breaks below yesterday's lows and if it breaks below April 12th lows right here around 4900, then we have probably going to have a run on Bitcoin and obviously a top in place. so we can look for a short, but not until we get below 49, 48, 50, 48, 80, that type of area. that's the only time we start looking for a short. then we know we're well below the 10-day moving average. we know we have a cycle top. we'll be riding the lower Bollinger Bands at that point, then we'll be in a short-term downtrend. then we can look to sure. at the moment there is no clear-cut path here for risking a lot of capital and therefore we are in a wait-and-see type of mode. okay, so that's the analysis for Bitcoin. so a little bit of a change since during the week where I was looking at this uptrend. now this uptrend for now at the moment is temporarily broken. be aware of that. that's a trend changer. potentially again just play defense right now. no, no point in trying to swing at something here that's very difficult to hit. okay, first request is: bat basic attention token looking good still. chart looks beautiful, still a nice. rising 20-day moving average. 10-day fairly, fairly well above price. still at the 10-day moving average. we have kind of up, down, up, down, up. so nice rising, step up type of trend back at this area here, which is sort of the highs from early April now back down becoming lows and testing that area. I don't know if you want to be trading the alts right now- this is the only problem. but if you're going to be trading anything or if you're going to be holding anything, right now bat is one of the strongest and this is this is the one you want to be holding. okay, so this one here looks like it's still going to continue higher. hard to say, though. we still have a little bit of rollover in some of the technicals. but again, if you bought this or bought the breakout, hold it. do not sell this right now. this still looks pretty good, I think, if it stays kind of while the price stays above this 10 and 20-day moving average. I like to hold charts like this and keep going with it. so nothing horrible about this. this is probably one of the best looking charts and even when you extend long term out, you see that it's clearly spent a year or so in this, in this triangle here broken out now and showing some real good strength. obviously, bat has some some news as well with the enablement of being able to now tip and compensate more content providers and so forth. so they've expanded on their, their technology and delivered towards their roadmap. I think this is also fueling a lot of this move. so some of this may already be priced in. some of this may eventually come and retrace back to the breakout point, something to be aware of as well. could go either way in that sense. but overall, a good looking chart and this is definitely a maintain a position, or add on pullbacks as well, all right. raven coin seems to be a fan favorite, but it is breaking down. we- I covered this in last week's lining report. I put this line in here. it's kind of like a get out. right now. this is breaking down. this is in the downtrend. there's no doubt about that at all. a downtrend has been established: high, a low, a high tested, tested. those lows came back up, didn't make a new high, came back down, made new lows. this now is in the downtrend. this is an avoid. I would not be trying to pick a bottom right here. the next place you can pick a bottom- it's actually not that far away now- a 10 percent lower. but I think this point here is significant. it is kind of when it first listed on Binance like a week in back in October. then we had this move in March to test, came back down and then broke out with significant sort of you know style came back down. now I think if it retests this breakout point, kind of at the 900 area, could be an opportunity to get long if it can reverse. so what we look for is not just a touch to buy- I don't think that gives you much- but if we can get down and touch that line and then come back up and reverse, then what you can do is you can buy kind of this area here and then use the breakout with a little bit of cushion as your stop as well. so we're looking for a retest of this breakout point and then it can then maybe go higher again and start a new uptrend as well, like this. that would be the goal. long-term holders, I think you want to still hold this. this is not not an unusual kind of pullback. it did, obviously. I mean it's come from you know: 250, 300 Satoshi, up to 1700. that's a massive move. so this type of longer term retracement is not unusual when you see a pattern like this. next request is for hot or hollow- uh, 25 Satoshi here. this is a micro, micro cap not doing anything I like at the moment. this looked like a big consolation, uh, sort of a big pennant almost, um, but now more of a triangle it's breaking down. so, uh, where do you put this line? it looks like it should be somewhere like that: broken down, 25 Satoshi. I think this is heading back down to this sort of 20 or 20 or 15 area. in my opinion, don't look at, don't, don't like anything about this chart, to be perfectly honest with you, unless it can come back and break this line here, um, the downtrend line here. that's the only time there's anything positive to to be had in this type of chart. next chart on the list is vet: um, this one here is coming back now pretty sharply, uh, like many of the altcoins showing at the moment. so we had this big base that was good, starting to come out. didn't really do a whole lot, although in percentage terms not too bad, but this type of weakness we're seeing here on significant separation with the moving averages is showing a pretty significant downtrend here. this is an avoid until these can find a new low kind of break, um, not that it's a defined uh downtrend like that, but until it can kind of show a new pattern, maybe show a low, a high and then a new higher high and a higher low and a higher high, so show us that's broken the trend. there's really nothing to have here. otherwise you just kind of, you know, try to catch a falling knife, so to speak. but right now it's much closer to the lows of december and january and february than it is anything else and for that reason i think we are going to probably bottom test all these areas here before it does anything. so at the moment, again, this one is also an avoid the doge coin, a fan favorite for sure, but not looking good right now. lost all the support from uh december, january and february. had a nice move recently, of course, but now it's below that. so let's just look at a couple of important points here. this sort of area, here it's lost the november lows it is testing, and then there are further lows before that. so, yeah, this one kind of has its own. you know, this one here is a candidate for in the future doing some cycle work on, because it has a very distinct community behind it and a very established community. so i'm pretty sure if i dug deep into this one, this could probably have some type of their own cycle pattern going and it looks kind of cyclical as well. if you look at these kind of sharp troughs and peaks that it's showing here, you know it possibly has something going there now long term wise, i think you know. so there's no, there's no short-term trade from the moment, unless it can kind of reverse and start maybe getting back about. let me zoom back in, get back above kind of this area here at 50 and keep going. but if it gets down to this sort of 36 level, i think this is a long-term buy and hold for sure, because it has shown the ability to get up up into this 100- 115 area, which i think it will again at some point. this, this coin, is not going anywhere. it hasn't established history. so long-term holders, not a bad point even right now to get in at this one, but definitely if it gets down to 36 or so, for traders you think you want to look for a reversal and a swing before looking to get long. so here's another request: um covalent, never heard of it, never seen this chart before. very first time looks, uh, relatively new, at least on this exchange. didn't see many other exchange options for it. um, not too bad. i mean it started off here at a pretty high point, so it's down 50 or 60 percent, like a lot of them do when they newly list. um looks to form kind of a bottom here. now it's coming back up, retesting. you know i, i don't know, i don't know enough about this to give an honest opinion. overall it looks like a media star to break, to break down. i think it has to recover this 10 and 20 day moving average and continue this trend so kind of put in the bottom almost right here and establish sort of a new trend like that. if it can do that and get back above, you can probably buy that and go along again. from a trade standpoint- just a trading standpoint- i don't see any edge just looking at this chart to get long. nothing strikes me as an opportunity for the person that requested this. if they like the tech looking a long term, that doesn't look too bad. it looks like it's sort of found the bottom here. it's come back a little bit. not a bad spot to get in, not a point to panic, that's for sure. so this overall doesn't look too bad from that perspective. okay, zen is one of my picks. looking through my list, this one here looks uh interesting. not a buy yet, but has some good volume and good price strength today. i think if this here remains the bottom, get it back above the 10 day moving average. here we could be looking at a long opportunity. so, uh, nice, good sort of comeback off a nice uptrend. if it can re-establish that, it's a possible trade idea, take a look at that and put on your watch list. take a look at the altcoin market cap. uh, good breakout coming back lower. this looks similar to a lot of the charts could be looking at now a balance off the initial breakout point, which would be positive. we could be looking at a continuation, especially if bitcoin has topped. it's possible that alts can at least hold their ground, not necessarily rally, uh against sort of like the usd, but at least maybe uh outperform bitcoin in the coming, and that would be very bullish, because in the bear market, when bitcoin dropped, all coins got crushed, and so in the bear market, in the bull market, when bitcoin drops, the altcoins can outperform. not saying it's going to happen, but it's possible here that we're looking at kind of like a bounce now or maybe a near bottom. you never know, it could be looking at something like this as well. that would be very bullish if we do get something like this and that would be very much confirmation that the bull market is back in, because alt have now established a new uptrend as well. but it's hard to say. bitcoin dominance went pretty high very recently, so it's a matter of just wait and see. but this is where we want to see a lot of the bleeding stop in the altcoin space, kind of in this area now the next couple of weeks. otherwise it threatens to break back down, market cap get below kind of the breakout point and then you really don't know what what you're dealing with. but we do have to watch out. you know we do have a lot of charts that are completely broken down. look at xmr to to um, you know monero to btc- where i thought it was going to be a nice breakout from a triangle. it's now reverse and making new lows. not very good, uh, look at this one: go chain making new lows, nice surge high. i got everybody excited. now making new lows. zrx looking- uh, looking like it might break down and making new lows as well. you know, zil, breaking down new lows, key self key. breaking down new lows. mkr was a good chart for a while. there completely lost it. now, uh, giving back 50, 60 percent. these are brutal. these, these all coins, i mean they can make you a lot of btc, a lot of usd, but, man, if you hold them for too long and if you don't get out and take your profit, you're going to get crushed. and this is the lesson, and- and this should be the lesson for the next altcoin run and the one after that, because it's going to be quite a few of them- too many people make good money and they end up actually losing more than they made because they feel as if they get addicted to the gains and it's very difficult to divorce yourself emotionally from the gains. and people go looking for more and more gains. they keep buying the dips, they keep buying the drops, thinking that's going to continue, like it did for them in the earlier part of the rally, and of course it doesn't. and then, once they get into a very sort of negative position, it's hard for them to close it out because it's in a lost position and they don't want to show a loss, for whatever reason, on their um. you know on their account. so this is just another example that a good looking chart that everybody's talking about doing really well and now doing horribly. don't hold stuff like this. cut your losses early. put your stop losses in um. you know it's okay to be wrong. you're only. you're only. you're only gonna hold yourself accountable. you're the only one in the end that's gonna judge um and you're the only one that's gonna look at your own performance, and your win-loss ratio is meaningless. the count balance is what matters in the end. so just be aware of that. okay, all the best. that's the lightning report for today. hope you have a great weekend and i'll come out on monday with the next version of the bitcoin cycles report. all the best to you.
