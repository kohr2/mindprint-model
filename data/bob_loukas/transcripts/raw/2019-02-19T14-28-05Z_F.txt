Hello Bitcoin Live members it's Bob Lucas it is Tuesday morning here in New York I hope you're all doing really well I have a very exciting video for you today it's it's the first time in in quite a few months in fact that we do have some very positive action on the charts here and across the board this time we are seeing strength we are seeing volume we are seeing some really nice and encouraging moves it has been a long 14 month grinding bear market I don't know if that bear market has ended I suspect from a price perspective that it may well be the low back in December it's hard to say but I think we are now well advanced in the bear market and we're now into that final kind of chopping motion or chopping range of a bear market before then building a base to start to begin to get out and I think what we're seeing right now is an early cycle rally that for the time being at least should create a decent amount of fear of missing out amongst participants and should create a decent amount of upside momentum I don't see this turning lower anytime soon of course always risk management process dictates that we are prepared for a surprise against our position and against our you know analysis but right here I still believe we are only on day 13 so let's take this this is from the other day I believe we're on day 13 of a cycle I believe we will exceed the day nine high set in the last cycle so I do believe we'll exceed the 4200 area I also believe that the market is really hungry for a rally here so I believe we're going to see a move up to that day nine high probably form some good resistance at that point fall back maybe sharply just to kind of shake out all these extra leverage longs here people fomoing in right this at this level here between now and say the 4200 area but then I think we actually rally sharply and and this is just you know me talking out loud looking at the tape looking at the chart but also looking at just just the fact that we're overdue for a good sizable rally bitcoin hasn't seen the last cycle was decent the cycle before that was almost non-existent you really have to go back into august of last year which is you know a long time ago already to see any sizable rally and even that by bitcoin standards wasn't anything special so I just feel that bitcoin even if we have bear market lows ahead of us in 2019 I just feel that it's really overdue a nice sizable rally and of course those sizable rallies really only come in the early portion of a 60-day cycle we are in the early portion of a 60-day cycle this to me is looking really positive here we had a nice surge higher consolidation now we're really starting to stretch out here and I believe we could easily see like you saw here in the early cycle uh last cycle I think we can easily see three or four big green bars all the way up into this sort of 45 4800 area you know again I don't want you going out and betting in ridiculous size and leverage purely because I'm thinking this could stretch another thousand dollars from here my point is that we have momentum now behind this cycle we are in a new cycle so I think we just want to let it play out and see how much higher this market can really go at this point so I'm long now uh bitcoin as of the break of the january 19th high position is in around about the 3790 area I'm just going to let this ride my stop right now is at the lows of these candles down here though they are pretty far below at the moment I'm looking to start to to right you know to increase that stop level but I want to give this a little more room here I want to give this a chance to even come back all the way back to the 10-day moving average which at this point would be probably below my position easily below my position entry so give it some room at this point because it is early in the cycle um but anything below these candles here right there would you know would not be uh hang on let me see if I can draw that in would not be something I I think you'd see in an early cycle rally so kind of that level there anything below that point now would indicate to me that we have a very quick top and of course a very quick top here without making a new high above the December 24th high would would be very bearish there's just no doubt about that and it's a possibility in cycles and in any market of course but uh it's a possibility that we do see a an early an early cycle high that does not exceed if that happens you want to get out pretty quickly and that level here at the moment would be a you know would be a loss in the position of course but would protect your capital to the downside because I just think anything below that point anything below that line right now just would would not seem right from any cycle rally perspective you want to build momentum in a cycle rally and you want to see higher lows and higher highs and that right now is already kind of a low um here's established low so I can leave that blue mark in there just as I had these blue marks they represent recent lows in in the space I could probably get rid of this now as well so we've now exceeded a significant point here next significant point would be this generally the eighth high around 4100 that's also very close to the 42 30 area this high so these two here probably from a block perspective let's see if we can draw a rectangle in I'm sorry for the noise background noise the building's heat is going on let's see if we can draw in a rectangle if I can what am I doing here here we go so something like this right that area here probably provides the next level of resistance for this cycle and then it'll bounce off that possibly a couple times and then move higher um profit target I really don't have a profit target at the moment I think I'm gonna let this one play out I have a feeling we we may again stretch higher so I want to I want to take advantage of it here I want to move my stuff up as soon as I can but I want to be able to make some really good capital if this market moves higher I'm not going to be in such a huge rush to take profit because we are early in the cycle and I do like the way this cycle low ended with it staying above the December 15th lows the fact that it had an entire cycle almost an entire cycle except for the first nine days but the fact that it had um what is that 54 days of decline sorry 44 days of a decline without breaking below December 14th that's bullish so I want to give this some room and I can already see as I'm recording this live this is still moving you know this is still moving well so you want to get your position in if you're not in already hopefully you're in already on this line I did I did advertise the fact that if we did have an upside scenario back when I wasn't sure whether it's too high one more low or one more high I did mention that this would my this would be my buy-in point this would be my point where I was wrong on the downside and need to go to the upside so we want to be able to flip quickly our bias and our perspective when the market dictates so this is what I'm seeing right now let it play out I'm not the type of person that's going to sit there and watch this price on the minute by minute chart I'm in now and I just let it ride the more you watch and worry about how much profit you're earning on a trade the more the opportunity you'll have that you'll close out quickly because you just can't handle the gains so just don't do that just watch it let it play out I'm going to go over a couple of other positions I have I do have my XMR position still going almost came back to this new stop point that I that I published which was the break-even point so now it's still showing a decent profit giving this a chance my profit target is still up in this this area here at the 10% area which which equals the December 24th high so I'll take 50% profit here and let the rest ride at the moment the worst case here is our break-even so that's a good position to be in at a break-even point if this can move higher then obviously I'll move the stop but that's the first target for the Monero XMR position and then Bitcoin Cash let's see if we can feel that I'm also in on this I had a alert on the on the trend line it broke the trend line I got in I like Bitcoin Cash from a price chart perspective only because I do we do know that it does pump every now and then and when it pumps it goes really hard like it did here and also before the fork between ABC and the SV clients it used to do this all the time so I'm thinking or hoping at least that this although it's not looking too great so far today it's reversed back quite a bit but I'm thinking that I'm hoping that this is going to just extend and extend extend and then I'll look for a profit target much higher up I do want to bring up my stop to break even fairly soon but I want to give this a little more room at the moment before doing that so at the moment the the stop is still below just right at these candle lows here but I do want to bring this up to the trend line entry point fairly quickly but again I want to give this a little more room because there is the possibility that you kind of get a quick pull down to to retest the breakout point and then and then it goes that's also a possibility so leaving that as an open possibility at this point and Ethereum Ethereum looks great look at this this is really a this is a bottom here and I think this is also a bear market bottom for Ethereum right now um we did see I mean like Bitcoin did the same thing of two but I'm not ready to call Bitcoin a bottom yet but I think Ethereum is showing and the altcoin space is showing a lot of relative strength and relative outperformance to Bitcoin so I think we also now have the makings here of a kind of inverse head and shoulders pattern I think we're going to rally higher at this point I don't know how much higher but we know that Ethereum is capable of really moving when it needs to and this seems to be stretching here so there's no reason why I just couldn't sort of keep going up at this point at least until the early March period when the Bitcoin cycle will most likely top I would think for this cycle so I think it could do something like that up to the 200 area and if we look at previous points in the decline then this here is a really big cluster I would think let's see if I can get a rectangle going yeah so uh kind of this area all right that that's there's a lot of a lot of activity there I would I would expect that here offers the top for the cycle here so that's still a decent move from this point it also is a new high a higher high so we will have a higher low in place and if we can exceed this 160 dollar area we would have a higher high so that's that's the definition of a trend change so that would also be great as well so looking for that with Ethereum this is against the dollar of course but I think against Bitcoin it's going to show a similar outperformance as well so here we have the December low here we have a higher low so this is not against the dollar this is against Bitcoin this is important because this here the fact that it stayed well above the Bitcoin low whereas in prior declines it was well ahead of Bitcoin so it was making further lows versus Bitcoin as Bitcoin was also making lows against the dollar it's now reversed that action here and I think we have the bear market low for Ethereum and also a bear market low for many of the altcoins because of this very chart this to me is telling me that we have a pretty significant low in place it would take a long time to grind its way back up but there is a lot of room left here before this can get anywhere near level seen in 2017. So this is great this is very encouraging to me this is very positive I'm not saying go out and really buy altcoins but we now want to start looking at some of these altcoin charts and look for opportunities because we may have the momentum behind the chart to to get in with some some confidence Litecoin is also showing the way here Litecoin versus the dollar looks to be now certainly making a bottom so this here looks very positive I think we have the next big pivot area which is around the 70 to 80 dollar area sorry 75 to 80 area there's probably no reason why this could not quickly move up to the 75 dollar area in this very cycle and that makes it almost a triple off the bottom here and again these type of assets that move uh in significant multiples to the underlying Bitcoin asset so as on the way down as it sort of you know moved at a pace of four or five times the rate of Bitcoin it's going to do the same thing on the way up just as it did in 2016 and 17 as it also did in 2014 and 15 this just this is just moving at a much much faster rate on the way up and on the way down so if if we do have a bottom here in Ethereum altcoins and Litecoin and we also if we have positive action in Bitcoin we should should not be surprised to see Litecoin really exceed and excel here over the next month so this is something you want to be getting into I do have some Litecoin coming from a long-term position right now I don't have a trading position in it but this is definitely a very positive very positive development here on the chart and then Litecoin to Bitcoin again it's also it's also made its lows this is a similar looking chart to Ethereum this is doing well starting to step up now so we've got this rounded bottom pattern and now we're starting to take out levels seen on the way down so this is something you want to be paying attention to and if you do like trading Litecoin then you've got kind of the green light as far as I'm concerned to to start looking for opportunities so uh that's that's the wrap up for the main coins let me just quickly browse through some of my charts and I'll I'll look at these on the fly um but this is Stellar which I was not bullish on this was making brand new lows although you know every every dog has his day they say as they say so this one here right now it looks like it may have formed a low and this one should do well now I think everything's going to do well it looks like from an altcoin perspective versus Bitcoin I think because we have positive momentum we have you know new volume coming into the space it's the old coins that would do better in that environment Bitcoin should go up but everything should outperform it and I think this Stellar here although Stellar wouldn't be my choice because it didn't it didn't outperform on the way down I think you're going to get a knee-jerk reaction more than you are going to get any significant um you know outperformance from Stellar though it looks like other coins like Ethereum and Monero and Litecoin would do better than something like a Stellar but again there's still room here as well the one that's not doing well is Bitcoin SV Satoshi's vision uh it's not doing anything in fact let's see if I can get a chart going here here it is although I do think this will pump eventually I think every you know everyone will have their day um but at this point I'm just I have a trend line here with an alert I think if this if this trend line breaks with some volume and some size then maybe there's going to be a move here but it's also possible that there's just no interest in cash SV at this point as well so I'm definitely staying away from this I actually sold my forked SV coins I have not sold my Bitcoin cash coins but I have sold my SV coins just don't believe in any of this project I think it's a pure fraudster type scenario with Craig Wright so I have no interest in holding any of these coins um BNB finance this has been a phenomenal run this may go again this could be consolidating but I just don't know um I don't like necessarily trading I mean I like positive charts like this this is great trend but it's also it's also been extended since December or November in fact late November so maybe this is kind of like time for something else to have a run and this could pull back a good pullback I probably would be interested again but at this point I'm just uh not really that interested in something like Binance mana coin so mana uh decentral and I do have some of this um this looks like it's now broken out somewhat well I wouldn't call it with size but actually this isn't too bad of a chart uh so we had a sort of sort of a breakout here looks like it came on a good volume a good bar there I should say it's come back maybe to retest so if this can make some some moves higher at this point get back over the 1000 satoshi level then maybe this could be a buy with a stop above the low point of the recent candle that's also a possibility OMG broke out and has not done anything since not sure if this is anything I would get excited about I did have an alert on the breakout of the channel I didn't buy it but um it's it's possible that this goes higher but at this point you really want to see more uh enthusiasm from from charts like this that break out this doesn't seem like it had any Qtum here is building a nice rectangle base looks like kind of a head and shoulders bottom here starting to get some momentum has a long way to go before I get excited at this point you could in theory again these aren't clean patterns you could in theory look to go long right now and then use kind of the stop right here at 500 satoshi that's only a 10 decline so you can get a you know a little bit of a position going risk around you know 0.5 of 1 of capital on there's something like this only because you have momentum across the board in the altcoin space and ethereum it is early in the cycle this that could bail you out at that point so there's a there's a chance here that this could maybe just do something like this over the next cycle you know and that in itself can provide you know a good three to three to one or four to one risk reward entry at 550 exit at 500 profit target around about 700 so um you know not nothing not an amazing opportunity but something here that looks like it could play out purely based on on what ethereum is doing what the altcoin space is doing and the chart pattern as well and then raven coin nothing going on here it's retraced the entire move since listing on binance um nothing to get awfully excited about unless it starts to make some make some some some moves and show some momentum some volume and comes back to break this kind of trend line all the way back to 278 satoshi from over well over a thousand that's a typical kind of pattern that we're seeing over and over again with these new coins at list i think it needs a little more time before i get too excited on something like this xmr i think i already showed xrp here is uh kind of struggling and and i think if the altcoin space is doing well this one might lag it's been there's been some some negative i wouldn't call negative press but the jpm jp morgan coin might be placing a little bit of um might be placing a little bit of pressure on this coin here because many kind of consider ripple the banker's coin and jp morgan comes out with their own coin so this could be a topping pattern it did hold off from breaking this this sort of neckline that had developed based on these two on this head and shoulders pattern it held that it's come up but it's reversed that now i think if this breaks below cleanly breaks one percent below this neckline it's a short at that point at least give it a go you know so this is something to watch out for at the moment i'm not bullish on this that's definitely something i can say looking at this chart and then i'm going to end with zcash zcash did break out of this wedge looked really promising i actually did draw last week when it was up at this point i did draw in a retest of the breakout point and it did exactly that actually even went much further than that and made new lows so the fact that it made new lows kind of negates um the pattern of a breakout of a wedge and going off to new highs or not new highs but a new rally at least however it still is looking like it may rally from this point again i just like other charts better than this one i think there's a possibility that most of these charts actually go higher but the question is which one is the better looking chart overall and and this one based on the level of a sell-off here the fact that made new lows here on february 18th which is already a new cycle for bitcoin tells me that i don't want to be in something like zcash it doesn't have the relative performance that i would look for to bail me out in in a room in a move higher okay i did say i'll end in zcash but i'll actually end with 0x protocol or zrx token and this is similar here although i have this from a long-term hold it's not performing well at all it's not it's not showing us anything to get excited about we have new recent lows here as well i want to be if i'm trading at the moment i want to be in the coins that made lows back in december and made a higher low here in february with bitcoin and not ones that are showing more uh showing lows here more recently that's just just not the type of coin i want to be in at this point so that's the wrap up for today encouraging news i think we're looking good overall we just want to see what bitcoin can do at this point look for shakeouts look for look for some sharp moves um back you know look it is it is up 400 in five days right so a 200 pullback at any time is possible um don't leverage in with a size or position that you'll get shaken out of with a 200 move you want to be um you want to be positioned long but not greedy long where you just can't control your position again as always if you have any questions please post them in the bottom here i'm happy to answer them and again i hope you're doing really well have a great week and i'll have a video out in the next couple days all the best
