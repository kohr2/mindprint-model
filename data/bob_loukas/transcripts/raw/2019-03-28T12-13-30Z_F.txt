Good morning Fintech members it's Bob Lucas Thursday morning in New York around about 7 30 in the morning I hope you're doing really well this is your midweek update going to be a quick update here on the cycles let's look at the S&P to begin with so we obviously have a top in the cycle right now this looks like the top for the second daily cycle there is an interpretation perhaps that this here is daily cycle number one around day 50 or so kind of deep for my liking we have seen we have seen the S&P make shorter cycles more often than longer cycles which is the reason why I side with the day 31 interpretation both of these are obviously either too short somewhat somewhat too short or somewhat too long for a cycle low ideally the cycle low would be in the middle here it's not the other reason why the day 51 cycle could could perhaps be it is that we have a nice correction down or a nice decline down into this area here if I turn on the Bollinger Bands you'll see that it came all the way back down as opposed to this one here which would looks like more of a blimp than anything else in that case it would make this little cluster here the half cycle low this would be the daily cycle low it's really hard to say I don't think it matters a whole lot in the end because the half cycle low and the full cycle low kind of act in similar ways and the reason why I also bring this up is if this here is the cycle low then we're looking at the next cycle low coming up this makes it early day 30s day 32 for example drop below 10 day moving average an attempt to get back above the 10 day moving average that failed now hanging on to the 10 day moving average which in theory should then drop down and make a move to at least the half cycle low point right here or slightly below us maybe slightly above that would be the target now if this is the cycle low right here then we're only on around about day 13 this this drop should be a little more shallower that would be the half cycle low coming up into this area obviously if this is the full cycle low then we do not want to drop below that that would be a cycle failure that would be a top for the entire investor cycle almost certainly and that's not what we want to see so a couple of different interpretations here I think the overall takeaway however is that we're still in an uptrend still looking um still looking for higher prices I guess unless we see a little firmer evidence that we you know that we are topping now if if this is the cycle low right here this is the half cycle low if we do get a decline down below the half cycle low point that's also pretty bearish it's not indicative of a top on the investor cycle but it still is somewhat bearish as well so I think bulls certainly want to hold this area right in here above the the low here at 27.22 that's a pretty far drop anyway that's an 80 point drop I think if we dropped 80 points at this point and below that is pretty much telling us that we could be looking at a top at the weekly cycle level as well I think in this area right here I dropped around about 27.50 27.55 on the S&P index would set us up for looking at a long trade potential I would be looking for a swing low in this area if we can get that over the next sort of three to five days that puts this count at around about the day 40 mark so everything would be pretty well aligned at that point if we get sort of a drop in this sort of zone here um I wasn't drawing that really well I wanted the rectangle um let's see if I can get that back so here's the rectangle yeah so kind of in this zone here uh over the next let's just say you know five to ten trading days or three to ten trading days get a little drop into this area and then a swing and a reversal higher that would be a buy for sure all right gold took a trade this morning um got in probably could have gotten in a little earlier I wasn't uh wasn't really around yesterday to be honest with you in the afternoon although I would have gone I would have gotten in on the cross of the uh 10-day moving average so I'm a little late to this entry here uh hopefully it doesn't hurt me in the end but I think this is clearly a top the only problem that we have is that if this is for some reason right it doesn't look it but if this is the investor cycle low um and this is a first daily cycle low then we're going to be looking at um kind of a half cycle drop probably only to around about the 12.90 area and then a strong move higher I still want to favor what I've been covering in my reports which is that you know this is just a very long extended cycle and we still need to see an an investor cycle low drop in that case this uh this cycle low here or at least worst case this cycle low right here which is a clear cycle low um needs to be exceeded we need to sort of get down into kind of this area here probably bounce off this longer term kind of rising trend line that's around the 12.60 area plenty of room lower wouldn't cause a whole lot of technical damage if any and I think that would be maybe enough of a sentiment resetter to get the you know to get gold kind of going back up like this as well hard to say because again this has been acting uh very strangely with a lot of strength so I do want to be mindful of being sort of caught short again so my stop right now is at the open of this second candle or yesterday day before's candle I should say right around the 13.16 area I am keen to get this down as quick as possible there is a decent amount of gap right now between my entry and the stop here but I need to give it that much room just in case it comes back up before dropping down but again like I said I want to bring this down probably to at least the top of the wick of yesterday's candle 13.12 I want to get that to that point quickly and then maybe even to the open around about what is that 13.09 or so and then of course if it keeps dropping then we want to bring that stop down as quick as possible um let's take a yeah just taking a look at some of the the juniors and some of the miners in general I mean I've never seen an investor cycle low in the miners that looks anything like this so again this could just be telling us that there's a huge amount of strength here it's just going to surprise us kind of similar to the 2016 early 2016 mini bull market that we had in the the miners and gold where it just it didn't let you get in unless you were in and you managed to ride that it just it just you know you just stayed that that position it could be something like that um hard to say it looks like we have a big double bottom here but I do want to see at least some type of drop and this is not enough for me here even though it's sort of 10 10 for the miners is really nothing at all uh and look at the uh the seniors here the seniors are just showing a lot of strength this decline here uh last week or two weeks ago is just nothing on the on the chart here so you know I just would love to see some type of sort of punishment here get us back down into this area here and then you can go this is one of the reasons also why I still think the icl for gold is still ahead of us but again I will respect any price that we see in gold any strength and try and get out of the way and if we do see a reversal in gold then I would probably jump back on and go long for sure for example getting back up and above this 13 20 area right here is extremely bullish and I would want to get long because at that point we would have at least a day 13 15 I'm going to be sure what the count is maybe day 18 high and that's a first daily cycle for sure and I want to be in part of that I don't want to even though it may come back into a dcl I'd want to be long because you just don't know what type of surprise and the upside you get from that point taking a quick look at crude as well so crude looks a little bit like the equities came out of this half cycle low congestion or consolidation area popped up a decent amount got to the 60 target that I that I had in mind for crude looking at maybe even 62 it has not happened has sort of double topped to some extent now below the 10 day moving average I think this is going to come back and sort of test I didn't want to do that sort of test you know maybe this sort of 57 dollar area for the dcl but there's still you know crude moves you know in pretty extreme sort of fashion so there is room all the way kind of down to the 55 area and even below I mean this this cycle low is all the way 51 so anywhere in this area or this range is sort of fair game for crude as low as maybe even 50 sort of 350 350 that's a I mean I don't think it gets that low but it's a potential just got to be aware of that as a cycle low and then it can rally back up who knows after that it all depends on where we want to go in general with the equity markets and risk on in terms of how much further it can go in the next cycle and then let's finish with the dollar dollar's doing the same thing whipsaw up down up down up down slight cycle failure here telling me that this move now will not make a new high this is a reason why gold could really get get some momentum but the question is how much more does this go I mean it could rally up come back down and then go up again and then start to form the icl it's still not that not that advanced in the weekly cycle we have an icl right here in january so we do have potentially a couple of months even to may or even june before we can expect sort of a larger this sort of decline I think there is room let me just redraw this here let's get the tool out there is room for something like kind of like this dcl right here and then kind of come down into the icl numerous ways this can play to be honest with you even though we have a slight failure here that came on some some significant sort of I think it was jobs data or some some type of news that pushed it down and it rallied back up so don't necessarily put a huge amount of you know of weight behind this being a dc a daily cycle failure we still are in my opinion up in an uptrend even though you know again there was a sort of a slight failure right here in general though the trend is slightly higher on the on the lows certainly higher on the highs so um still a little bullish overall on the dollar here even though there is signs that we could be topping and then longer term of course this is still an uptrend and this looks like an ascending triangle to me which would be a continuation pattern in an uptrend so a lot of reasons to be sort of cautious here and um cautious that in a sense that don't expect a decline or a massive decline if you're long if you're long gold or want to be long gold for example the dollar still is still king in my opinion so I'm just I'm just really playing it both ways you know having an open mind and where it can go all right so that's the update midweek update I'll have a report out during the weekend of course on Sunday wishing you all the best take care
