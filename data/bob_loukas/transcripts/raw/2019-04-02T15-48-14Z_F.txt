Hello everyone, this is Bob Lucas. It is April the 2nd in the morning here in New York and I hope you're all doing really well. So the Bitcoin four-year cycle is in. The December lows right here mark the end of the prior four-year cycle. A cycle that went for 52 weeks lower in a bear market and 153 weeks high and the bull uptrend for a total of 205 weeks, just three weeks short of a full four years. This video is an update to the four-year cycle video I published on YouTube around January 15th. A video that was recorded originally back in late December, right when we were looking at this decline here in early to mid-December, it was about a week or two short from this final capitulation here. I think a video was posted on one of these declines here right at the beginning of December. But this December low here on December 10th, or at least the week of December 10th, now marks what I believe with and nothing's ever certain in trading and investing, but with a very very high degree of certainty or at least high degree of confidence that the four-year cycle low has ended. That four-year cycle low comes at a perfect time in the four-year timing band at 205 weeks and really does not leave any further interpretation for a low to come in the future to make or complete the four-year cycle. If you had watched that video back in January, I did talk about the possibility that the February low, the 60-day cycle that was due could exceed on the downside, the December low, and then that would stretch down to become the four-year cycle low. But that hasn't happened. Instead, what we're seeing here is a whole lot of strength into this new four-year cycle and a move now just today above the prior to 60-day cycle highs. So this move today here on April the 2nd is essentially for me confirmation that this December low does mark the four-year cycle low. We've got too much separation in terms of price, but more importantly too much separation in terms of time here for this move to be anything other than the beginning phase of a new four-year cycle. For all your investors and hodlers out there, really the four-year cycle is all for you and about you and back in January I made it very clear and in video since that you don't want to be looking and waiting for further lows. We are deep enough and were deep enough in this bear market in terms of price at an 85% decline from the high and also in terms of time as we already approached the four-year cycle time frame for the next low. This here was the opportunity to start accumulating and as I said many times to make sure that you have a fully loaded position, a position that you're comfortable with, a position that you can take higher and not risk essentially your livelihood and your family's livelihood but enough of a position that would make the difference in the long run. Now it is absolutely way early at this point. It is not too late to be invested or fully invested if you did not get and heed that warning and get your allocation correctly. It's only Bitcoin at the moment is only $1,000 essentially off well maybe $2,000 off the lows here not even $2,000 off the lows. In the grand scheme of things this is going to be kind of a rounding error to some extent and it is not too late. At the same time you don't need to panic right there's probably going to be now a period of consolidation from this move and a sideways continuation of the sideways move similar to what we saw when the last four-year cycle ended. So let's go back now four years almost exactly four years right here and pretty similar time frames in fact if you look at the end of the last four-year cycle coming off a 58-week bear market decline you see this massive drop and good volume into January as opposed to the recent low which was December and then you had a nice sort of move higher but then kind of a partial retest it really wasn't a retest on the absolute capitulation price points there but a retest at least to the closing point of the candles here and then a nice rally higher and this is kind of where we are right here I think if you can relate the same if you can overlay this is a similar type of move here where I think the market has a recognition there was also a higher high that was kind of put in here the last time and this is kind of recognition that the four-year if we were tracking the four-year cycle load back then in real time this development is similar to what we're seeing now where it kind of confirms a higher high structure in the market now similar though to today I don't think we're going to escape at least without something similar to this and this here you know scared the hell out of a lot of people back then it came down from you know it doesn't look like much here because we're dealing with a small number essentially but from a percentage standpoint from 317 all the way down to a low of 198. this decline here back in July of 2015 was almost 40 percent down to the bottom which is obviously more than significant this would have whipped many of the new bulls out of position it would have whipped many of the people buying late and it wasn't late of course in the grand scheme of things but buying here after sort of a 40 or 50 percent move these people here probably a lot of people here leverage a little too much or bought an over position thinking that it's going to continue rapidly higher and then probably gave up a lot of that puked a lot of this out right here before then rallied and never looked back now if we go back to the current period here this is probably something similar a lot of people probably buying a lot of extra bitcoin right now thinking that we are going to see something phenomenal like this occur and hey i never want to rule any possibility out in trading and investing but i feel very very strongly that this is not going to happen not going to see anything like this and people who are buying with this type of view or scenario in mind are going to leverage up a little too much they're going to buy way too much they're probably going to either borrow uh maybe even use a credit card for example but essentially buy bitcoin with funds they can't afford to lose and then what might happen instead or what's more likely to happen at least is that we get a lot of chopping we may get some more higher prices but we may even get something like this okay and this would come down into the next cycle low uh the 60-day cycle low and then that type of move would punish anybody that's over leveraged right here in the short term so the point of this is that if you're trading sorry if you're investing for the long term if you have that four-year cycle play in mind and don't overdo it right here the type of potential and reward that we have ahead of us for the people who are patient over the next three to four years is so great that you don't need to be leveraging or risking too much capital right here that's going to throw you off position if we do get a nasty shakeout and if you look at the four year cycle low here this was nasty but this to me was perfectly expected uh i certainly was short the entire way um but we haven't since then had a nasty shakeout so the last shakeout we had was five months ago bitcoin and actually almost any asset class if you look at gold as well how it trades it does like to inflict a maximum amount of pain on traders and investors and i don't see how we get above this eventually above this six thousand dollar resistance area without a major shakeout at some point i'm not saying it's coming this week or next week or next month it may not come until august okay um we have to get through a number of these 60-day cycles still but it's i'm pretty confident in saying that at some point and let's just draw out a few of these here so we have a 60-day cycle april we're looking at another one say in june okay we may not get let's shake out here until august so let's just draw in something like this bear with me one second here drawing in the highs and the lows of course all just hypotheticals here all right all looks great until we get shake out so let's try and clean this up just a little bit here all right but the point is not for neatness the point is to say that some point maybe even as late as let's just say august we get a 60-day shake out here we get this really horrific you know one and a half thousand two thousand dollar decline even and that's perfectly normal in many regards in any market whether it's a bull or bear market but even in the bull market you do get these nasty shakeouts you know one of the things that you're going to do is to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market and you're going to make a bull market all these people that are just getting far too excited about the possibility ahead buying way too much than they can they can handle and then what ends up what happening is that not only do they sell and capitulate on this fear and believe it's going to go down and break below the december lows but they end up losing on the extra leverage and they end up losing their strong hand position that bitcoin that that position in bitcoin that they never was going to give up or didn't want to give up because of the panic and the fear and the amount of losses they're inflicting so you end up in a situation where not only are you kind of out of bitcoin or have a very light load because of this type of sell-off but you end up losing overall on the market and then something like this in a new four-year cycle if it was to occur is more likely to be a v-shaped recovery in price so we would get a shake out but then we would get an almost immediate bounce back back to the point where it started breaking down from to begin testing that zone before maybe wanting to come back out and then begin a more sustained full market trend now that the accumulation phase is over i also want to point out that from a short-term standpoint and a trading standpoint i'm able to flip between viewpoints on a daily chart rapidly so i'm not going to give you and i will refuse to give you day-to-day views on where i think the market's going to go because again you know i can be short one day and can be long the next day so it's uh it's pointless in doing that so take a lot of these short-term lines and squiggles i'm drawing um with that perspective in mind these are guides i like to focus on time i am a time specialist more than anything else with with the study of cycles and the lines i'm drawing here are simply more for guiding purposes and nothing else so you know i don't have a crystal ball here um i like to work with the time frame more than anything else so we could also see you know a more immediate move lower back here kind of get below here and then sort of chop sideways a little more and then come back into this point i think overall what i want you to take away from from with this analysis is that i now firmly believe uh basically a 98 belief right because it's never a hundred percent once once you go absolute and stick to an absolute statement you're going to be uh you're going to be screwed essentially from a trading standpoint you'll never be able to get away from that view and that bias and you'll be trapped regardless of what price tells you but i have a kind of a 98 confidence level now that's the december cycle low is in and that we are now into a couple of daily cycles 60 day cycles into the four-year cycle we are three or four months into the four-year cycle and the four-year cycle if we look at the prior two cycles as our guide i'm going to try and zoom out a little bit here i believe will run for approximately 150 weeks the prior two cycles ran for 153 weeks in the bull trend and the one before that zooming down was 142 weeks so again just a guide just an estimate for planning purposes but looking at around 150 weeks to around the october 2021 time period it's a lot of time right and a lot of room to move so lee as an investor and a hodler put that into perspective how this market squiggles and wiggles and and you know also oscillates here over the next coming three or four months is irrelevant to you as a long-term investor if you continuously are waking up in the morning and checking price but you're a call yourself a long-term hodler uh or investor then you're doing yourself a disservice by allowing price fluctuations in the short term to influence how you invest in the long term very important concept please try and really appreciate that statement and understand your time frame and be happy to be in that time frame from an investing standpoint and ignore what happens just as you should have ignored this three two thousand dollar decline you're going to ignore to a large extent even though you're going to be happier of course but you're going to ignore the one or two thousand dollar move higher because your prize is up here your prize is a couple of years away and it is up here okay not designed to not designed to get everybody really pumped up but that's really the prize that's what you're in this for this is the four-year cycle horizon that we're looking at so um again let's see if we can kind of give give you i'll give you an outlook to what i see potentially happening here over the next few months and then maybe let's just stretch it out to the four-year cycle top first thing i believe is that this six thousand or fifty eight hundred to six thousand dollar level on bitcoin is going to act as some significant resistance it provided significant support on the way down in the bear market there was repeated and repeated attempts to break below that everybody thought that was going to hold and the market was going to go up i did not and and i don't want to get into necessarily why at this point but from a descending triangle standpoint i think the breakdown here was obvious but at the same time there's going to be a lot of resistance at this point when it comes back up to test that area i don't know when it comes to test that area that's that's the key or the problem right now i don't know exactly when we test that point but i think it'll happen sooner than later we could even get that in the next week we can get that in the next few days we don't know but let's just say for argument's sake we get up here and we test that would just be the first test i think at some point and i'm just going to draw this in again again loosely right at some point maybe around the august time frame we get down and we i don't think we get anywhere near necessarily the december lows we probably get closer to the february lows okay around about 33 3400 um again arbitrary numbers i'm throwing out it's more about time so i think we get down here and we scare the hell out of all the longs they get worried that it's been kind of seven eight months since the low it's taken too long it's now reversed lower they start to panic they're too leveraged and of course they get they bail out talked about that five minutes ago let's move on here then i think we come up and we kind of start testing this area a few times now i don't know if we can get above that period about that 6 000 point in 2019 i gotta be honest with you we've got to be patient here it takes time to build a solid foundation and a solid base in any new four-year cycle but at some point we probably do get above this six thousand dollar level and once we get above that we may drop quickly back down but then we get it back above and then that same level begins to act as support okay and then we can begin to find an area that has um you know less less weight and um less friction and we will then begin to accumulate or to begin to to rally higher with a little more intensity and velocity okay so when does the rally in the next four-year cycle really take hold and what you notice here is that most of the gains in the four-year cycle occur right near the end and it occurs quickly and rapidly and very few people take full advantage of it and it's just too difficult to do if we go back to the original four-year cycle this is the breakout point right here in january of 2013. the major top occurs in november of 2013. 11 months from exceeding the prior high and then rallying in this case from 13 or even like sort of 20 or 30 dollars here to 1 100. that's the gain of the cycle in 11 months then if you look at the prior cycle and you look at the 1100 top from the first four-year cycle and you draw across here's the breakout point the breakout point occurs in april of 2017 think about that april 2017 to december now you're talking about only six months of or seven months to the next high so from the april highs of around 1300 to 20 000 pretty much the entire gain this is where new all-time highs come in right so for approximately almost four years we don't have any new all-time highs and then we see a sort of 15x move occur in seven or eight months or 10 months i'm sorry i keep confusing myself there but you get the point point is that most of the gains the really big speculative gains occur only once price hits a new all-time high again so what happens in the meantime is you get this accumulation phase and awareness phase institutional phase and it's only the retail phase right at the end where most of the that's called dumb money in the retail money and and no offense to anybody listening many of you probably got in at some point right here the last cycle okay that's when it gets really heated but we're in this early early accumulation phase not even really the awareness phase at this point smart money accumulation this is where we want to be and this is why it doesn't matter that price is up a thousand or two thousand off the lows and it doesn't matter if you buy right now if it drops another thousand or two you're in the accumulation phase at some point what we're going to see i'm going to draw this backwards some point if we expect the next four year cycle low to go 150 weeks across okay again no absolutes here we're using just guides but if we take that and then we draw backwards a date and we want to go let's just say nine months back okay so we want to go 36 weeks this here is the point where it exceeds the prior highs so i'm going to draw from the 20 000 level to here this is the point where and again this is all guides i can't stress that enough where bitcoin probably exceeds the 20 000 level and begins to go parabolic and then from there does a 10x 15x whatever the number is nobody knows but this is the point 36 weeks from the top or around nine months give or take that it begins to exceed so then if we know that or if we believe that's roughly how it work and we can start to kind of draw this up right so first test back down another test another test and then go okay that here and again this is not very neat but it's not supposed to be you can look at the prior move here and the one before that you get these 60 day cycles of rally up above the bollinger bands back down up above the bollinger bands and back down for example it's going to be something similar to that probably get a nice shakeout a couple of shakeouts along the way as well so we see most of 2019 below and accumulating in under the six thousand dollar range at some point let's just say in october we get one spike maybe above okay it gets everybody excited come back down it's not until maybe towards december that we start to really put price above the six thousand and and then behind us okay um maybe a few retests lower and then early 2020 so let's just say a year from here we begin to get full awareness now now we have price over seven thousand uh getting up towards eight thousand it's now more than doubled if not tripled called getting closer tripled off the december lows people are starting to come back in that were probably invested at some point in the last cycle and now this is more of an awareness phase much more institutional money starting to come in okay probably an etf is approved by this point maybe a year out or so so we're starting to get a lot of interest now building in this but still retail does not believe now retail won't believe until we break 20 000 and cnbc comes on and talks about you know all-time highs and that all that type of thing it's all repeatable every cycle is the same okay but this then becomes a situation in 2020 where we start to fill the gap between that six seven thousand dollar range and the twenty thousand dollar all-time high of 2017. and that comes and completes all of 2020 and then into some of 2021 where 2021 is the third year and third year is typically the biggest year in a bull market at least the secular bull market and that's when the gains begin to get ridiculous so then what happens from that point is really anybody's guess my guess is that we have yet another similar move if not a bigger move in terms of percentage-wise than the last two i believe that the 2021 bull market top is going to be a massive blow off top like you've never seen before and i also believe and it's not for this video that that's going to mark the top of what is a 16-year cycle we see 16 17-year cycles in the equity markets and gold and many other markets and i believe that this will mark right here the top of a 16-year cycle so four of these four-year cycles this sorry about that this is the third then there'll be another fourth the fourth one i believe will be a massive four-year bear market but that's that's for later time that's for 2000 and sort of uh yeah 21 to worry about but i believe there'll be a four-year bear market going into the sort of mid 2020s decade but that's to come right here is where we get this massive blow off top and from here 10x from the 20 000 top and we've done 10x before from from the breakout point 10x to me is not much okay and 10x in bitcoin is 200 000 and 200 000 is only and this is rough numbers i believe around about 3.5 or 4 trillion dollars in market cap which obviously is a phenomenal amount right but now we're talking sort of 13 years 14 years into adoption and we're talking a much different game right here uh possibly and hopefully a massive light lightning uh technology adoption so we're talking about different environment we're talking about etfs we're talking about uh institution we're talking about 401ks involved a worldwide phenomenon at this point so we're looking here and i'm looking at least at the blow off top phase okay and then i believe 200 is the target um i would probably be out of a lot of my positions by that point but this could overshoot you know and that's obviously too much but this could overshoot i think possibly even as high as the 300 000 level is is is possible uh and not out of the uh at a question for what we're seeing right here then we can look at of course just like we have seen now i move back down now where does that move take us below if we look at prior bear markets around about 85 percent of the move is retraced okay but we always stay above the the top from the prior four year cycle so not that it's important right now but um this move if it got to 250 000 and 85 percent retracement brings bitcoin back to around about 36 000 so around about 36 000 in october of 2022 uh would be your four year cycle low it's probably uh actually i think november but in this time frame is the next four year cycle low drew at around about the 35 let's just say to 50 000 range so what's going to be important is that we are invested that we have our eye on the prize that we are accumulating we are taking profit at some points some minor profit but then that we are fully invested and also understanding of the next four year cycle and that we more importantly during this last phase here uh scaling out and not scaling in or not buying in and we're certainly taking up a huge amount of the profits up towards the top and only have a small amount you want to always have some bitcoin of course uh for the long term and forever but we want to be out for most of this because we don't want to ride like many of you did you don't want to ride another four year cycle low down 85 percent you don't want to be holding bitcoin from this level today at 4 000 to 200 000 and back to 30 000. okay that's going to be the goal for us over the next four years or the next three and a half years is to take advantage of this opportunity now does it have to work out this way it doesn't right we could be looking at a double top with 20 000 and then the next four year cycle low coming back down to 3 000 that's a possibility i don't want you to think that the cycle has to play out in this way i'm only telling you how i believe it's going to play out based on a longer time frame 16 year asset cycle and the fact that i believe we're still firmly in a secular bull market for bitcoin and under that scenario this is what i believe is the most likely outcome to play out and that's why we still have to be aware of the alternative possibilities we have to be aware that we could indeed be looking at sort of eight years of sideways chop right where it gets to 20 000 kind of does something like this it's possible and then the next eight years you get the point right it's more of a sideways chop that is a possibility which is why i keep saying when you invest today you're getting in near the bottom of a four-year cycle and that you're investing with money that you can afford not necessarily to lose nobody can afford to lose anything and nobody wants to lose anything but you're not betting everything on this right you're not going to cause catastrophic harm to you and your family by putting in way too much at this point because there's no point there's no need if we're going for a you know 30x move from this point or a hundred x move from this point you don't need to be more than let's just say 10 of your you know of your wealth allocated to this and that's even high you just don't need to okay because we're looking at such massive gains not only that if you're putting in too much capital at this point if you're if you're looking at the potential here and thinking about owning private islands and a suite of fast cars what's going to happen is you're not going to be able to ride the big capitulations or the big shakeouts that the market's going to give and there will be shakeouts and i'm talking about 20 and 30 percent corrections in bitcoin over this period at some point if not one at least one but if not one of you at least maybe two or three and if you're taking in the mindset that i'm going to put everything in right here then you're not going to be able to hold those gains you're going to basically give it back you're going to sell out at some point and then you're going to then you're going to be in an undesirable position that you're not going to have you're not going to be focused on the plan and the four-year cycle and you won't have the full position that you need okay so that is my summary that is my update since the last four-year cycle video this is overall to me very encouraging this is great news but keep your eye on the prize keep your eye on sort of the possibilities here for shakeouts but again like i've been saying in all my videos the last two months or three months you want to be from a long-term holders perspective fully allocated get your allocation now and be happy with that allocation be happy even if the market turns lower at this point be happy that we are in early during the accumulation phase of bitcoin thank
