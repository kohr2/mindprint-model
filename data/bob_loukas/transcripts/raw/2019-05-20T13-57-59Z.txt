Good morning Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas. It is May the 20th here, Monday. Hope you had a great weekend and wishing you a great trading week starting today. So let's take a look at the Bitcoin cycles for today, the typical Monday report. Looking at the daily chart right now and the 60-day cycle, from what I can tell, I believe that we have a day 52 top in place. We tested or came close to testing that yesterday and the day before with a nice move higher, I believe it was on Saturday afternoon or could have been overnight Saturday to Sunday morning. But that was, I wouldn't call it rejected, but it didn't go on to make new highs. I think that's because we still are in the latter part of the cycle and I have an expected cycle low coming up now. Well, we're in the timing band, but coming up in the next sort of five days or so would be the day 60 area. Right now it looks like we are consolidating the massive 52-day rally that we had going back to this. We'll break our point really is where the cycle started in my opinion, but from a low perspective, we have that set around March 26. So it's been almost two months now. It's been mostly higher over the last two months. It's been amazing. It's been an amazing run really, but I think we need to consolidate some of this move here. And I think we'll find that we probably will consolidate a lot of this move in the next cycle as well. But for now, I don't think we make new highs. I think any new highs now means we have a cycle low in place. So this is kind of an important area right here. This rally here was above the Bollinger Bands for a good sort of 10 training days and then rode most of it higher. So there's a lot of profit taking, I think, still to be had right here before we can probably look for a cycle low. But I'm not expecting a massive or a significant decline, to be honest with you. I like the structure of this. I like the nature of the rally. I don't think we want to give up a whole lot of it. I think we want to spend a lot of the consolidation via time. I think if we go back here and look at this sort of breakout point, that's kind of my downside target here. We did hit that on Bitstamp because that was where most of the selling occurred last week. On most of the other exchanges, I think we went down to 66 and 68 in between kind of that range, which is kind of in that area. But I think I moved down to 64 to 6,500, kind of sort of matching this breakdown period here. Is my expectation. Of course, again, no real science when it comes to short term price predictions. Again, looking more at time, but just be patient right here. I don't think now is the time to be pushing more long trades with leverage. I think you want to be sitting in BTC when it comes to your trading accounts. I've talked about that quite a bit where you want to be denominated in Bitcoin because of the upside potential. But we really have had a significant rally over the past cycle. And then the last two cycles before that were more consolidation of the bear market. Zooming in a little more here. I'm going to go to a four hour chart because we are getting sort of in the timing band for a cycle low. So, yeah, here's the move here. Nice up here. Kind of a, I wouldn't call it a bull trap necessarily, but a slight new high here. That pulled the market down significantly. I think that confirmed that we had topped. Then now an attempt to get back higher, sort of failed to make new highs, failed to get above the initial surge. And I think now we just spend a little bit of time going lower again down to the 64, 6,500 area would be my target. And then from there we can look at sort of, let's go back to a daily. So we can look at kind of making another run higher. But again, I'm not, I think we make new highs in the next cycle, but we may need to kind of, you know, rain back our expectations a little bit. Now that we've had a doubling in price, I think it's possible. I'm going to go to a weekly chart now and look at the cycle here. So we've got this move lower probably end of this week or next week. We can look for a cycle low, look for it to kind of bounce back up around this 6, 63, 64. Like I said, 64, 65 area, which corresponds to kind of the breakdown back here in November with the start of the final decline. That would be great. But then I think the next cycle kind of comes up to maybe, let's just say the 9,000 to 10,000 range. Even that would be, I wouldn't say optimistic necessarily, but I think we could be looking at maybe even a left translated cycle to come. And then maybe some chop around. And this is where, again, it's not a science. I think we have to respect the uptrend and think of prices moving higher over the coming time. But I do still like the idea of consolidating a little more of these gains before moving higher. So the next cycle after this would not be due until kind of August with a late May, probably like early August, I would think. So that's why I've got a market around the August 5th, maybe even late July timeframe. So let's look at a high, maybe around the 10,000 and then a low around, you know, maybe even a double kind of double bottom here. But whatever low that we put in now for this 60-day cycle, I expect the next 60-day cycle to hold that. And actually, in general, now that we have the making of a, you know, sort of a new bull market being built at this point, I want to believe that most of the cycle lows will form higher than the prior cycle low. And that's what an uptrend is. But I don't think you'll find it'll be the case in every cycle low. We're going to have some shakeouts and shakeouts will occur with what we call a failed cycle. It's not until we really get to the very latter part of a cycle, four-year cycle, like the final year, where you see a clear, you know, clear move higher, where each cycle low is way, way higher than the previous. Right now, because we're looking for some more consolidation, I think we could look for one cycle lower than the other. Or we could look for something like this here in the consolidation, where, you know, you've got slightly higher highs. Hard to tell. Point being, of course, is that we're now in this sort of uptrend mode. We want to be buying dips more than looking to short the rallies. But again, look at this candle. We've got three candles. We've still got the weekly candle above the weekly Bollinger Bands. So I think this is telling us right here with a potential or likely cycle top in place for the 60 days that we want to pop back into on a weekly time frame, pop back into the Bollinger Bands, maybe down back to sort of the 20 bar average here. And that's going to be around about this sort of area here in a couple of weeks. Actually, the 20 days, 20 weeks is from below that, but the 10 week, which is also a very good spot for a retracement in a cycle low in an uptrend. So I think that the 10 week moving average back to around about 6,300 in the next couple of weeks would be a good spot to bounce off. And then that will allow for the next cycle to begin, 60 day cycle, so the market can move higher again as well. But just be aware, everybody, you know, I want to keep the bullish theme front and center in your mind. You know, don't give up that long term position that you have. You want to have some skin in this game all the time, even as you're trading. Like I like to do, I like to have, you know, 50% of my holding in a hardware wallet where I'm not touching. I'm not being influenced by these major sort of rallies and declines. I'm not, you know, keen to sell any of those or necessarily add to them at this point. I have a nice allocation I want for the long term. But from a trading standpoint, you know, I think you can be in something like USDT at certain points like now towards the latter part of the cycle. So not worrying about shorting the market, but maybe being in USDT. Of course, the fear or the risk is that in a severely, significantly uptrending market that, you know, we get very short and shallow cycles. Like, for example, right here, you know, we could get a move lower down to back to 7,000, for example. That forms a cycle low. And then before you know it, we're back above 8,000 and more towards 9,000. So there's always a risk in having a trading position, not in BTC at this point. So stay biased in general is my overview. Stay biased to the long side and the bullish side, even though we know that when the market gets extended like this, even Bitcoin can easily drop 20% pretty quickly or even 30%. You know, and 30% coming off this 8,400 area is a move back to around 6,000. So even a move, even if this kind of goes back down to 6,000, don't be surprised and don't sort of freak out at least for the long-term position and from a short-term trading position. And that would be a beautiful retracement in an uptrend. It'll be a nice sort of 60-day give or take cycle low back to, you know, back to a reasonable spot. And goodbye to dip opportunity for us as well. All right, let's take a quick look at a couple other coins here. Ethereum BTC, a long Ethereum BTC. We had a nice move, really big move coming up. Now I spent four days consolidating. Catching up with the moving averages here. We do have a cross on the moving averages, which really is the first cross since March, which really started this decline here over the last couple of months. So I think this still looks pretty bullish to me. I like where this is going. I can see maybe even another day or two lower back to the 10-day moving average. And then maybe it can continue this moving higher. So I'm long ETC here. I do, sorry, Ethereum, not ETC. Ethereum to Bitcoin. Bitcoin, it's had, you know, it looks like it's had a good sort of three months of consolidation as the Bitcoin dominance obviously increased and the bid was behind Bitcoin. But I think it could be time for Ethereum to maybe start to outperform Bitcoin here. But what we don't see is across the board confirmation that some of the alts or the other miners or majors want to rally. That's the only concerning piece that I have. I'm not finding a whole lot of charts or too many charts that look encouraging. I was looking at Litecoin just a few minutes ago. Let me see if I can bring that up. So Litecoin BTC. So this one here, I was expecting it to maybe break out. It didn't. So this here is still invalid. Looks like the downtrend is still in play. I'm keen to get along this again here. But I definitely am patient and waiting for a nice confirmation that we do have a change in trend. And when we do get that change in trend, I think Litecoin will outperform again because it was, again, one of those coins that did outperform early on and consistently throughout. So December through to that April or March period where a lot of the alts did well. This one did the best. So I want to be looking for it to come higher. But right now, still in a downtrend, looking at threatening to come back below the May 13, 14 lows that were printed. So until it does that swing and breaks this trend line, breaks back above a 20-day moving average, I'm really not interested in Litecoin. And then the other coin I'm long is Ripple at this point. I do see a good bounce off an area here back in September that led to a significant rally. We have had a six-month, pretty much straight six-month downtrend. So I think it could be time for Ripple to start outperforming. It had a nice surge two days. It hasn't done much since, but it does look a little like the Ethereum chart where it's consolidating back. I still like the fact that it's sitting at the 10 and 20-day moving averages. So this would be about the point where this is kind of like a flag here, kind of like a bull flag or a pennant almost coming off this nice pole. It looks like it can move higher again. I think if it does move higher, it's going to confirm that we have a change in trend. And we may even be able to add some more to the position. But we still need to see this move out of this consolidation and higher. Anything, of course, at this point back above the recent high is going to probably lead to a more substantial rally, maybe even all the way back up into this sort of 8,000 area up here. Hard to tell, but we're still looking for that confirmation. Almost have a cross on the moving averages. And that would be the first cross since I'm not sure if there's a cross right there, but close to it. But really the first real cross since it started breaking down in December. So looking for that trend change. It's threatening a trend change. It has not confirmed one yet. I am definitely long this and just want to see if the chart will play out the way it looks at this point. All right. I actually took a hard, long look at most of the other charts. I don't really see much that interests me at this point. We had many of the altcoins and the top 10 look like they were making a good turn end of last week, but they have kind of turned back again as well. So there's very few charts besides the Ethereum chart and the Ripple chart that I see that seems to have at least a breakout, a viable breakout that has a chance to continue higher and change trend. And that's a reason why I remain long on those. Otherwise, I'm staying pretty patient in general, staying patient on the Bitcoin trade, even though I'm long, absolutely on my trading accounts and obviously my long accounts. So I've exposed to any upside, but from a leveraged long trade really has been a little while since I've been able to consider taking a long because this really was just far too powerful for me. So now looking for a pullback, get long on some leverage as well with Bitcoin. And let's have a look at what the Ethereum Ripple charts can do. And let's hopefully look for as Bitcoin comes into the next cycle low, if it can decline, hopefully the altcoins can hold up in general and then start to rally ahead of Bitcoin and put in some seller gains. So we can take advantage of that. But for now, I don't want to get in front of most of those altcoins because they still are in decline. That's the update for today, May 20th. I'll have an update out in two days on the top 10 coins. Wishing you a great week. Leave me any comments that you have below and we can talk. Otherwise, thank you.
