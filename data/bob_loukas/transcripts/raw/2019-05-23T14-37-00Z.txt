Good morning Financial Tap members. It's Bob Lucas, Wednesday morning in New York around 1020 Eastern. Hope you're doing really well. This is your midweek update. So some interesting developments going on here. It's looking a little dicey here for risk markets, looking at the S&P, pretty confident with the current count that we're on sort of day eight right here or day seven, I think it is, and turning over pretty sharply. Now we're not at a failed status right now. I am out of position right now. I got stopped out on that. I'm not going to hang around here for too long. Not looking like anything you'd expect from a cycle that's going to go up and make new highs. Very surprised that we have not at least exceeded the 10 and 20 day moving averages or the 20 day moving average at least. Really expected it to come up to this area here around 2900 to 2920 in a worst case scenario. Now it's not over yet. This could just be sort of a double bottom retest. We'll find out maybe even today, but more likely tomorrow and into Monday. Often we have seen some pretty violent Friday kind of reversals and closing strong. So still likely or still possible that we get a dip in tomorrow and then we can begin kind of a move higher. Um, I don't know. I, again, like I said, I'm out not waiting around for something like that, but certainly do not like the way this is shaping up at the moment here. Uh, again, on day eight, typically if the cycle doesn't go off to new highs, then it starts off pretty strong and doesn't really look back all that often, except for maybe, you know, uh, deeper or maybe around day 10 to 15, we get kind of these pullbacks, but overall, this is not looking positive at the moment. And also this sentiment seems to, seems to have soured a little more now, um, with a lot of the, a lot of political sort of unrest that's going on, um, the tariffs and so forth. I think they're getting a little more serious here. It's becoming a little more than just, um, words and, and sort of back and forth sparring between trade groups. It looks like it's now going to probably cause a little more damage to maybe the economy and then obviously earnings and so forth. So with a cycle, a weekly cycle getting at least definitely past the midpoint, getting slightly late in the, and now, um, this is a danger and it's something to watch out for. Again, I did definitely expected new highs. So I'm, I'm surprised if this, uh, I'm surprised that this weakness so early in the daily cycle, the third cycle, and I'm surprised if we don't go off to new highs, but now the way it's looking, uh, I just want to be protected and not long anything like this. If it does fall lower and drops below to sort of 2760, 70 area, then comes back up, then I'd be interested in shorting the, the move back to the 20 day moving average. We typically do get one of those certainly at least to the 10 day moving average. So I'll just draw that out real quick. This is the, the bear case kind of scenario. Um, let me get another color. All right. Can't find my color tool, but if it drops down, let's say something like this. Okay. I'd be interested in this move back up and shorting that move right here, a little deeper in the cycle because it's too early enough in the cycle where you would expect a good, a good sizable rally at some point, even if it is in a failed status. And even if it is declining towards the next investor cycle load. So I would look later in the cycle for any sort of short opportunity right now, we still have the possibility that it does save itself and move higher. I'm not sure if I'd want to get long again, but if I did, I would want to look for kind of a trend line break back up, which would put it back above the 10 day moving average. And then I may consider taking another long, uh, at that point, but only if this does not fail. And if it reverses, for example, if it reverses today, that would not be necessarily a bad thing. Um, so that's what I'm looking for on the S and P tricky markets here, folks. It really is a, a very sort of chopping environment. Gold here, I think, has also chopped out quite a few people. I'm, I'm, I'm just glad I got out pretty much a break even on my, on my miners, but right now they're rallying again and gold is actually doing really well here. Um, so it did not fail as a cycle. I don't know if this ends up being yet another kind of cycle low here that did not make a lower low. If you look at the silver charts, they did make a lower low. So we do know that I, well, I, we don't know for sure, but I think this is still the one declining investor cycle. So it's possible here for gold that this still is all one investor cycle and that the invest cycle actually ends here, although it's not the price low, it's close enough to a double bottom and it's more of an extension in time. So if we do break higher and rally, then this probably becomes the weekly cycle low, but again, there's just not enough evidence to go either way. It's hard to get bullish in a market that's still showing for the most part, lower lows and certainly lower highs. So until gold comes up and exceeds this May 14th high, it really is difficult to say that we're in a new investor cycle. Now you could try and jump in again here like I did in this breakout thinking that you're going to get ahead of the curve, ahead of the cycle and, um, you know, take some juicier gains, but I just don't see the, uh, the benefit of doing that at this point. It's just too much risk in getting stopped out and getting sort of cut to death with, uh, you know, false starts and so forth. So I think we need to see some clarity here. We need to see this, uh, evolve either higher and, and show us that it definitely is some type of new cycle boom right there that confirms it because the fear is that, you know, the, if the equity market right now reverses, like I just showed you. So if we go back to the SMP, if we do put in kind of a reversal today, form a green hammer candle right now, and then it goes higher, continues a third cycle, then today in goal just becomes a trap. And then it would actually come lower again like this and form maybe an, you know, an eventual final ICL for equities while at the same time, sorry, for gold while at the same time in the equity market, you get something like, you know, this come up to maybe double top, double top or make, make new highs and then top there for the third daily cycle and also the investor cycle. So a couple of different scenarios here that could play out, not enough clarity overall in general to, to push the envelope on any one trade. So for right now, I'm just going to sit on the sidelines. The, uh, the, the equity market and the crude oil, uh, trades I had on both stopped out, not what I wanted to see. It was looking so promising. Let's go over to crude oil here and look at that. That's, um, this is, this is definitely weak. This is definitely a failed cycle here. I don't see any other rule interpretation. Um, this looks like it's a day, I think a day nine top and a day 10 failed cycle. So if crude is gone, then it stands to reason that the equity markets will also follow at some point. And this is why I don't want to go along. Um, and this is why I'm obviously out of, um, the long positions and I'm not very keen to, to go along as well because of this type of thing here. Um, so this could be a short opportunity, but again, it is stretched now on the downside is below the Bollinger bands. I think once this finds kind of a, a low and comes back up and test the 10 and 20 day moving average, we can look for a short opportunity also early in the third cycle. So we should expect at some point, a counter trend move higher. Then lastly, looking at the dollar made slight new highs again. Um, another daily cycle top maybe is playing out right now as we speak that would provide of course, gold with, um, a bit of a tailwind to go higher, hard to say the dollar is trending higher, has been turning higher, making higher highs the entire way long series of daily cycles higher, but on the, uh, the weekly chart certainly is, um, overdue. Let me see if I can find that. No, yes, there it is on the weekly, definitely an ascending triangle. That looks like it's starting to pop up above it here. And if it does that, then it may not look back, but at the same time, uh, the last ICL was back here in January. We definitely drew one, but I think it could also, uh, it's a mistake. There you go. I think it could also drop back down into this 96 level and then move higher as well. Many, many different interpretations here, but overall the dollar on the weekly chart is bullish on the daily chart. It looks like it wants to come down. So again, multiple different, uh, viewpoints here could go either way. I think it's time to be cautious overall and in general with this market, looking at gold for long possibilities and looking at short opportunities for risk markets, but too early still in the cycle. One last look at gold here. It's starting to see some divergence, RSI divergence in, um, in this consolidation period here. Um, definitely lacking your, you know, your capitulation sell-off into, you know, down deep below the Bollinger bands, kind of like this here, the ICL right here. We see that pretty often in an ICL, but from a time standpoint, we do have more than enough time on the decline here. So it could be some good accumulation going on here. A lot of the indicators are telling me that we should be moving now more than happy to see a new investor cycle begin for gold because of the amount of time that's elapsed since this August. I mean, it's almost, you know, it's a nine months now, which is almost, it is unheard of for an ICL. Um, so more than ready now to see this move higher. But again, I think we want to see confirmation around about 1302 breaking above that candle gets us above the 10 week moving average, gets us even above the, uh, the 20 week moving average. So I think at that point, it would be safe to say there'd be enough separation, enough time elapsed that gold would be in a new investor cycle. I think if it does break that, there's still plenty of room to the upside. So it wouldn't need to necessarily, uh, FOMO in here and, and kind of like get in, you know, chase, chase, chase the market. We can wait for maybe the first daily cycle pullback or the half cycle pullback in the daily cycle to worry about getting long. This has been your midweek update. I hope you're doing well. I'll have a report out this weekend. All the best.
