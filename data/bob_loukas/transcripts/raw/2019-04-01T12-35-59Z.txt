Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Monday morning, 8 a.m. here in New York. I hope you're doing really well. I hope you had a great weekend. So I think we have a really interesting video for today. I see a lot of developments on the charts that get me a little excited and I don't get excited too often, but there's a lot of encouraging type of moves across the entire space, whether it's Bitcoin, altcoins, market caps. We're seeing a lot of really strong evidence that we could have and most likely have the four-year cycle low in December behind us. Now, let's get stuck into it. This is the weekly full cycles report where we focus mostly on Bitcoin and the cycles. Of course, the Bitcoin cycle is the main driver of the entire space with a market cap dominance of over 50% still. It stands to reason that the longest serving cryptocurrency and the most secure or the most mostly widely followed, sorry, mostly held and followed coin is the dominant asset class for this entire space. So understanding what Bitcoin is doing helps us across the entire spectrum of trading in the crypto space. So now we're on day 53 of a 60-day cycle. We are getting close to the next cycle low. The last cycle ended on day 53 where we are right now. The cycle before that ended on day 65. You see a few other ones 51, 56, 84. That one was the most stretched cycle that we've had. Point being is that we are now really close to the point where we should be seeing a cycle low. But here is the rub. Here is the problem or here is where it is not so clear. We are on day 53 where we should be in a really, we should easily be into the declining portion of the cycle by this point. Look at any one of these cycles. Look at the last one here, declining last 20 days, declining last 30 days. Not so much on this one here, but not, certainly not going higher. Declining, declining, declining. Every cycle by day 53 is declining. But this one is actually going up. It's rallying. I wouldn't call it rallying, but it's moving higher. It's every dip is being bought and it's moving higher. It's above the 10-day moving average. Its trend is higher. And this is confusing. Well, it's not confusing in the sense that we don't know what's going on. It's just confusing to the person that looks at cycles from a low, high, low, high, standpoint. We're expecting this to drop down and it's not doing that. So there's a couple of things that are going on here. One is that it's just going to be an extended cycle, meaning it's going to form a low around day 65, day 70, maybe even day 75, for example. So there's still time for it to kind of get up and come down as this chart here indicates. That is the first possibility and probably still the most likely one, because we always want to assume that we're going to get a price decline towards the end of the cycle. That happens in around about 95% of cycles, even the bullish ones, even the one that runs really late and doesn't decline towards the end. We often, know, we always see in the end that tail end dip, whether it's a shakeout, whether it's just a profit taking event, we typically always see it. Okay. So this still remains my primary outlook. However, there is another alternative here. And that is that we're going to see, and this is going to be new for many of you. Okay. So I'll try my best to explain it at a high level that also makes sense for you. But there's a concept in cycles that we can see a cycle low occur without a price decline, but it occurs over time. So what that might look like is something like, let's just get another color here. So it looks something like this. And typically you get the full cycle length when this happens. So all the way into day 65, say for example, 60 to 65, you get this type of thing where it hasn't gone down and it hasn't really gone up. This becomes what we call a time-based cycle low. And simply what it means is there is selling pressure because it is late in the cycle. People are selling it, but there is just way too much underlying strength and demand and buying support at this late portion of the cycle that the price is not allowed to drop. It's just not given an opportunity to drop because there is just too much demand buying up the asset. And what happens is all that selling pressure that exists during the decline, the declining phase of the cycle is then exhausted. And then once the natural cycle low comes, so around the day 60, 65 range, for example, once that comes and goes, the selling pressure becomes exhausted. So you've got this situation where sellers and buyers cause an equilibrium in price. It doesn't move higher or lower. And then because there was so much demand on the buy side and the cycle ends, the sellers become essentially exhausted and then you get this move higher. And these types of cycle lows occur, one, during reversals typically, and two, they come after this period, long period of, sorry, long period of accumulation, like we've seen over the last, what is now almost, almost four months, three and a half months. So this here at the moment is still acting as a, you know, pretty significant accumulation period. So this, this is what we could be seeing right now as the alternative scenario. Now, I don't, I would be a little surprised to be honest with you if we saw an upside move right from this point, because we are on day 53. What I want to see is either kind of more of a sideways chop for basically a week, the altcoins can continue going higher. And then it's eventually because it's a time-based cycle, we want to see it kind of into day 60, day 65. Then we want to see it come out of that and move higher pretty rapidly at that point. This would be an extremely bullish development if we go another week with just a sideways movement, even, yeah, even a week's fine, that gets us to around day 60 of the cycle. It seems a little early for an upside break to occur with a time-based cycle. So a time-based cycle low typically wants to go the full length of the cycle. Whereas something like this right now, if we are going to go down and dip, we want to see that pretty much beginning at this point right now. So any upside break from this point, like today, for example, maybe the next couple of days would probably be reversed because it is early and then come back down, shake everybody out and then move higher. So again, this isn't an exact science guys. This is a tool, this is just me telling you, looking at cycles for well over a decade, which essentially is telling me price patterns, right? And just me reading the cycles as I have with other asset classes and giving you my sense for how these typically evolve and resolve themselves. But they do surprise, they surprise often enough. So let's not be, let's not be so hard headed or absolute in how we interpret and how we trade these markets. We're looking for an edge. We're looking for ideas here on how to be prepared for the potential different scenarios that are ahead of us. I think the overall takeaway from this is that this is really bullish. Well, this is bullish in general. I think we have bullish action. And that's because if you look at this descending triangle, I was very bearish throughout all the members who have been with us since kind of the launch or when we're tracking this period right here, everyone knows I was very bearish and hopefully I protected a lot of people from this decline. But the reason why I was bearish is because we had consistent drops into and testing the bottom support area and the rallies were being sold short quicker and quicker as we went through each cycle. Now we don't have anywhere near as many cycles in this case, but you see the lows are forming higher and we're now testing more of a resistance line, just as on the downside, we were testing the support line, the bottom. So the support, sorry, the action here is coming from the bottom up and testing, you know, this area right here, as opposed to this coming from coming from the top down and pushing down, which eventually gave way. I think what we're going to see here is the same type of thing in reverse, where eventually this gives way and then we come up and we start to fill in this void here between the 4,000 and 5,000 or more like the 4,200 to sort of 6,200, $2,000 gap. That's the next evolution in my opinion. Still want to see this scenario play out. I got to be honest with you, I really want to see another move lower, whether it's a retest of this February low or retest of the December low, I really would feel much more comfortable with a really big shakeout because people are getting really excited right now on Twitter and in, you know, on blogs in general, I see the comments, people are really excited. That's good. I mean, I really, you know, ultimately I want higher prices like everybody else, but I want the market to not come back in the future over the summer and do a retest then. I prefer to see a nice big sharp retest from this point down to this sort of $3,000, $3,200 level and then come up. That for me almost puts a nail in the coffin, so to speak, for the December cycle low. Okay. That kind of completes the basing pattern as far as I'm concerned and allows the market to then move higher again. Whereas if we break from this point, I'm not saying we have to retest in the summer, but I won't feel as comfortable with a, with just where we are, where we stand in general as being the absolute bottom or at least probably I would be fine with this being the absolute bottom, but I still would be a little uncomfortable that we're going to get a massive $2,000, $3,000 decline at some point, whether it's June or whether it's sort of the August cycle low that we're going to kind of come all the way back at that point. So I want to see that come back right now as well. All right, let's take a look at the weekly chart. It's been a while since we looked at the weekly chart. I still think maybe 80%, 85% chance that the four year cycle low is in. That's a bear market low from a price standpoint. Still believe that, but I won't be shocked if it gets taken out. But if it gets taken out, it's going to happen soon because the four year cycle low is not going to stretch much further than, I mean, April would be, April was the date I said it could get to. I don't see it stretching all the way out to the June cycle low. I can see a retest perhaps in June, but from a four year cycle low standpoint, here's the capitulation volume. This is the cluster where I see the four year cycle low. This here to me is basing its accumulation and you can see the strength that seems to be building up here. First of all, the RSI is at its highest level since the 2017 top. Some of my cycle indicators here showing that we may be peaking for the short term at least, but we're seeing a lot of extra strength that you would not normally see during a bear market. We also have one, two, three, four, five, six weeks now above a 10 week moving average with a decent amount of separation between the 10 week moving average and where we stand today. Every time in the past we had a cycle high. So these arrows still represent the daily 60 day cycle high. So they don't really correspond to the weekly chart that well, but they tell you where it happened on the weekly chart and you can see each of these cycle lows put us above the 10 week moving average, but only briefly. So three weeks here, two weeks here, one week, two weeks, perhaps barely here and not even here. Didn't make it above. Six weeks straight above the moving average is, it's telling, I think. I think it's telling us that we're at least accumulating. I think we're going to drop below that 10 week moving average. Of course, we always do even in a bull market, see this, right? And those are massive buying opportunities. I'm a little cautious though, because we are sort of the last time we saw any real sell off or real dump was back here in sort of December, January for timeframe and Bitcoin, even, you know, you see this even in the bull market, it has its periods, right? Every, every couple of months of dropping the, the February cycle low was very mild, really wasn't any, any real volatility. There were some price declines, but it was very, very, um, almost coordinated, um, or scripted. Nobody really got, uh, taking out any fast action. So I'm a little worried that we haven't seen any fast action sell off yet. And that's why, again, going back to the daily chart, I would love to see this. This would complete this daily chart very well. And actually I think it would do a really good job in shaking out a lot of people who are very speculatively, um, leveraged and confident. So something like that, and this chart would look quite normal. And then we can go back and test this big block that we saw all the way through the bear market, and then we can build a base in that area. Okay. Um, not the prettiest looking charts, but you get the point. Um, so this is what I want to see right now. I think now because we have six weeks above and near the cycle low that this December low holds at least for this April cycle low, I can't guarantee what happens in the June expected cycle low, but I think again, uh, not to be too repetitive, but I think we have that 40 cycle low in play. Let's look for, and let's hope that we see this drop. If we don't, and we see upside action, then I don't think it's the end of the world. I've talked about everybody having from a long-term perspective, a full boat, full load. I've been talking about a full load for two, three months. Now you don't want to market to surprise to the upside and leave you behind and not ever allowing you to have a full position. If you're invested in Bitcoin for the long-term, see its long-term benefits, believe that we will see this price and this price come back again in the future and exceed it. Then don't mess around with a hundred, five hundred or a thousand dollars right here per coin. Get your position before it's too late. Okay. So that's the Bitcoin wrap up. I'm going to go through now over some of the altcoins very briefly, because we do that on Friday mostly, but I'm going to go over the ones I like and the ones I'm positioned in. I have issued a few alerts that have gone really well recently. So I want to cover those as well. Okay. Starting off with ADA. I'm sitting in a really big profit position right here. Did not hit my second profit target of 1800. Came very close. Came within 17 Satoshi. We just need to be patient. It's pulled back now. Pulled back a little bit, not a huge amount. It's still above the 10 day moving average, still trending higher. I want to give it some room. My stop is still down this on this wick here. I do want to get it up. I want to get it up to here pretty soon, but I'm just giving a little more room. See how it goes over the next sort of 24 hours. If it gets to 1800, I'm already out. Um, and we'll get out on that position of the second, third of that, that is letting the rest ride. So this still looks good. This is a big winner so far. I want to make sure it remains a good winner. Obviously, if it gets back to the stop, we're going to give back a good amount of the profits, but still have a healthy profit position. And that's why I'm eager to get this up pretty soon. Maybe up to this 1580 area, maybe slightly, slightly lower, below, below that, but somewhere in that area is what I'm looking for. Look at the ADA and the weekly chart as well. Nice rounded bottom at this point, right in this area here. Okay. Now we're seeing strong volume and we're seeing four straight weeks higher. Um, very strong technicals looks really good, doesn't it? So it looks like it could make it all the way back. Uh, this was my original kind of best case scenario. That's huge, obviously 4,100, but, um, and I wouldn't be in position by then, I don't think, but somewhere in this area is where am I looking for, for my second or sort of the final third of my position. That's where I'm kind of looking forward to get out around about 26, uh, 25, 50 to sort of maybe 3000 area is what I'm looking for. Let's take another, yeah, probably the peak, probably the top of that right there, those two candles there and the top of this one here is what I'm looking for, but this looks pretty good. So just give it some time, be patient. Um, it's already gone up quite a bit of the last sort of three weeks. So gotta be, gotta be patient in general with these. Okay. Long Litecoin. Litecoin has dropped a little lower, um, but still above my stop point. Just have to just keep an eye on this, this, this no longer is valid. Um, but keep doing that. There you go. Uh, that line there, um, look, just respecting, respecting the uptrend in general, respecting the fact that it consolidates and then moves higher, hoping it still does this. And if it doesn't, then the stop is not too bad on this one here, uh, fairly tight overall, but, um, this is what we're looking at for Litecoin. Just give it some, give us some time and some patience here. It has consolidated for a while. So if it's going to continue this uptrend, it's going to go higher pretty soon. Posted a new alert again. We've been following Qtun for the longest time. Um, so this one here, it's broken out. It's really, I mean, I drew this, this kind of trend line here weeks and weeks and weeks ago. It's kind of moved like that. Uh, it's now above sort of this breakout point. It may retest the breakout point. My stop's pretty far down this point. I may want to try and move it up soon, but I'm going to give it a little more time. Maybe another day. I would definitely have a stop update for you on the Wednesday's midweek update, but, um, this looks good. Give it some time. Give it some room. The upside potential here is pretty big. I would probably take profit on a 25% gain. And then we'll see from there what, uh, what happens after that. But, uh, this one looks promising to me, but again, some of these do end up failing. So we just have to respect what we get from a price standpoint. And lastly, my other position I'm long in is XMR or Monero. This is Monero versus the dollar, which I'm not in. I'm in versus BTC, but this looks like a very beautiful chart coming off, uh, this triangle here, broken, breaking out. And I've been following this for a while. And it's been on my watch list. I've been talking about it, but here it is nice move higher. Um, definitely, definitely look like the looks of this. I think it can move significantly higher, but it needs to create some separation. It had a nice move yesterday, the day before yesterday, had a nice move kind of yesterday and overnight. So let's see if we can get some more upside from here. Um, and just give it some time, give it some room at the moment. My stop is right here on this candle, but I want to quickly rapidly move it to the breakout point as well. Probably just below today's current candle. Uh, once it gets some separation, maybe tomorrow, um, if you can go a little higher, move up those stops quickly, but this one looks good. I think this one has now the potential because it does have a December low as well. So it's been consolidating for quite a bit of time, as opposed to other coins that have been, that have February lows, for example, uh, this one looks really good and just have to be patient and just, just trust the chart. If it works, it's great. You want to be positioned and you want to hold the position. If it doesn't work, then you know, let your risk management take over from there as well. Okay. My friends, that's the wrap up. I think this is exciting. I think we've, I think if you're here, you've been patient, you have, um, you've weathered the majority of the bear market, not to say that we're not going to have difficult times ahead. We may have them in the next week. Like I see show here. Uh, but overall you've gone through the worst of this bear market. You've gone through the majority of the time. I would suspect I think it's only going to look more positive going forward. I think the second half of 2019 is going to be phenomenal. Stick with it. Um, stay patient and keep learning and keep, um, keep, you know, using the right trade and risk management practices and you will be just fine. Thanks very much for listening comments in the section below. Happy to answer anything you post. Thank you.
