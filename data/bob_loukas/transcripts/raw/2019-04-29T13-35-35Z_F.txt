Good morning Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas, Monday morning on April 29th in New York. I hope you're all doing really well. Hope you had a good weekend. Let's get stuck into the weekly Bitcoin cycles report where we focus mostly on Bitcoin and the daily and weekly cycles. Take a look and see if we can find exactly what could be going on here with the cycle and give us obviously an edge from a trading standpoint. Now what I do see is we are at the potential midpoint and beyond just now. We do have a peak right at the day 30 mark, right above the Bollinger Bands for the second time. This here now carries a significant possibility that we have a top in place for the 60 day cycle. If that were to be the case, then we're looking at now the declining phase of the 60 day cycle. It would make perfect sense kind of being in this crypto winter or early bull market phase where there's accumulation where a 30 day top would be expected. Had a good move off $3,800 lows on the cycle up to almost $5,600. That's a $2,000 or $1,800 move and around, you know, around about, what is that, 20 or 30 percent, actually more than that. So that's significant enough. We probably shouldn't expect a whole lot more than that. And I also did think coming into this rally that the max would be around about, so the $5,800, maybe even $6,000 level, which that is the support area found in 2018 over consecutive 60 day cycle lows. So the fact that we're up at around 56 is probably enough at this point. Now, if it goes again and moves higher, I wouldn't be surprised, but at the same time, I would think we would be capped and, you know, and resistance would come into play and reject the rally at around 58 to sort of 5,900. So there is a very, well, there should be in theory, little upside left in this cycle at the moment. And now it's more about just looking at the cycle and seeing if it wants a hold in this sort of area right here, the area above these two cycle highs back in December and February, that hopefully becomes the floor now and the support and the resistance up here at 5,800. So do we chop around this area? I think we do for now. What I do see and what is common in cycles, daily cycles, is that we form sort of a mini head and shoulders pattern. So it's possible we kind of break down a little bit here, test these couple of low candles in this area from the earlier part of the cycle, but come back up and get balls excited a little bit more and maybe sort of form a right shoulder with a left shoulder here, the right shoulder here, the head here, and then start to sort of form that topping pattern. Come back and test this area one more time, come back up and then fall a little faster and harder and then fall down into the next cycle low. That is just a fairly common type of ending play out for a cycle. We often see this head and shoulders kind of pattern form often enough in the topping motion and then you see here you kind of have a nice arc going down from cycle to cycle. What I'm drawing here is the likelihood or the hope at least that we will have a higher high with this cycle and then this cycle and this cycle and that would make it one, two, three consecutive higher cycle lows in play and then one, two, at least two consecutive, well not so much consecutive, but two higher highs and this one being a sort of double top high. Overall though of course talking about an uptrend or the beginnings of a larger play uptrend in motion, so nothing, you know, this is just a matter of being patient at this point, letting time go by. We've talked about on the weekly level going out towards the summer months. I think we're still in this sort of big accumulation phase and an area here where people want to get excited. The market gives you something to get excited about but then does not follow through. Pretty typical of a market that you know is kind of still an accumulation and hasn't really busted out in a new bull market of course. Now I'm going to flip to a four hour chart to show you how I think we're looking a little more bearish right now. So here I'm going to try and zoom out a little bit more. Okay, so possible day 30 high, looking at the four hour now. So we had this move here, made a higher high but then came back down and this here is what concerns me the most. This type of action here is telling me that the top is probably in and if that wasn't the case, what I wanted to see here is a quick recovery and back up to rally and make a new high and that would have continued the uptrend that started all the way back here in late March. Didn't see that and now we're looking at kind of a flag pattern here more than anything else. It's not clean but it is a little bit of a flag pattern that's formed and for me it looks like, sorry I'm just trying to grab it, there you go, looks like we're starting to break down. That's why I think we may break down out of this sort of four hour flag pattern and come back down. Nothing too significant, $200 drop, test this April 11th low somewhere in that area and then bounce back up. Give the bull some hope in the second half of this cycle but of course like I said earlier, only come back maybe three quarters of the way up, form a right shoulder and then begin the more dominant decline of the 60-day cycle where here we're getting more of a decent sell-off and of course in the latter part probably from day, let's say day 50 and on then that's when we start to get a real acceleration into the cycle low. The key of course becomes how far down do we get in the next cycle low and that's always difficult to tell. It's more about price than it is sorry it's more about time than it is price and we do know that in a cycle decline price can exceed more than you expect after enough because the selling pressure is just more significant at that point. But I do think there's going to be a lot of support in this area, one because this was kind of where we were thinking it was going to break down the last cycle and it rallied higher so this was a very bullish move then of course we have the two cycle tops as well. So this area here around 4200 I'm thinking is going to provide quite a bit of support and if you look at it we're at 5200 that's a 20% decline that's a healthy and significant decline even by bitcoin standards. So that to me is probably going to be enough as of a decline. So this is what I'm looking for at the moment this is by far my primary thesis for what's coming up here in bitcoin let's zoom back out to the daily. Okay there it is there it doesn't look it looks pretty normal if you look at it from a wider lens at this point coming back down to that support area but then coming back up to fill this zone again and I think we're going to fill this zone over multiple 60 day cycles coming into late summer and beyond. And then the question just taking the time frame out even a little further is do we have a retest of the December or February lows some point in the cards in the future? I don't think it happens with this 60 day cycle but we could have a top here for we could have a top that may that may stay in place for three or four months so let's just try and draw something in here and you know I know I talk about this each week and it's important I do but we could be looking at the next 60 day cycle doing something like this okay so topping a little earlier than normal maybe day 20 day 25 not making a new high and then coming back down and coming down sharply and then into an August low this would be the big shakeout and I think that would be around the summer months good separation from the December lows this would scare a lot of people and it'd be nine months removed from the December low people would then pretty much claim that you know bitcoin's really dead at this point it's just done nothing for almost two years it wouldn't be almost two years but it'd be a good year and a half and and and then some from the big 2017 top this is kind of how we want shakeouts to to appear and then from here we can really get busy going higher and then of course you know the rest from there from the four year cycle video and so forth so this is what I'm looking at here two more cycles of possible pain or heartbreak and letdown of course as always like anything we want to be positioned long term for the possible surprise of an upside break and continuation that's why you want your full huddle position in place without question you don't want to be trying to time from a from an investment standpoint you don't want to be trying to be time a thousand or two thousand dollar drops you want to be in at this point but from a trading standpoint I think we're looking at the next possibility for a short to come on the second balance I don't want to be shorting yet it's only day 34 day 35 and we're in an uptrend so in an uptrend we don't want to be shorting unless we're late in the cycle and we have very clear evidence that we're declining but also from a long trade standpoint it's too late now it's too late in the cycle with a possible top in place to be looking for long trade so this again is one of those patient times for traders at least in my opinion and the way I trade in my style this is a time where I'm patient and I'm just letting other people chop around this market letting other people pay all the margin fees for sitting in leverage positions for example I just want to be kind of in this on the sidelines waiting for my opportunity to come in for my next trade all right let's just finish off on the bitcoin cycle on the weekly chart again healthy looking chart come up somewhat of a test of the support zone uh four week kind of flagging here this actually on the weekly is a little bit of a bull flag in fact this looks like a continuation possibly higher but I think we're not ready for that just yet to be perfectly honest with you I would welcome an upside surprise I'm bullish overall of course but I still think we have some downside work to complete before we're looking at more of that breakout higher so this here represents more that right shoulder right now showing a higher high let's probably move that back lower something like that then we're looking at a may low come back to test again this area here so let's put that in around 4200 possibly maybe the week of may 20th okay and then like I said earlier come back up doesn't make a new high move this in another attempt it doesn't make it and then I said I'm going to be looking at a higher high level of the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market and then I'm going to be looking at the market course after the summer months for now I think we still need a little more pain to inflict I think sentiment has gone a little frothy again and that's good because we are up obviously 2000 plus off the lows but I think we need a little more pain and we can go higher at that point again cycles from a four-year cycle standpoint December looks solid at this point as being the lows but nothing stops the market from going in on a really fast intraday maybe like within a sort of a 30-minute training period or one hour training period making a slightly lower low to me that wouldn't change the four-year cycle low being in December even if we get a new price low it happens sometimes on a fast market that we get a new price print that's lower the only time this does not become a four-year cycle low is when we spend a few days even a week below in new lows and that would not be that would not be part of the new cycle and we have to mark this as an extended four year cycle don't see that happening to be perfectly honest with you I don't see new price lows also but I do expect some type of test and if that comes in may even better if it's something ridiculous like this that's even better because then that gets that gets the bottom of the bear market in sooner as far as I'm concerned and the sooner that comes in the faster we can get up and go and start making headway up in towards the seven eight nine thousand dollar range okay so that's the bitcoin analysis for this week this is the monday report which is more in depth on the bitcoin cycle let's take a quick look at a couple of other coins that might be moving for the week so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so! so so so! so! so so! so
