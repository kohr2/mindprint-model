Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Friday morning in New York. This is typically the lightning report segment on Friday. But a couple of things here, I don't really have any requests from members. And also there's been, I think, some significant development in the market overnight and yesterday that I think we need to talk about more importantly. So this should be a fairly short report, but let's look at Bitcoin here. I think Bitcoin is in trouble. We had a, I'm going to go to a four-hour chart or even like a one-hour chart, in fact, just to show you this. So here it is yesterday. We had this really nice breakout. And as this was unfolding, I thought, okay, this is probably going to be the next leg up to sort of the $95, $9,600 area where we could be looking for that long-awaited intermediate timeframe top after the massive 180% rally. Unfortunately, it reversed very, very rapidly right here in the next hour bar. Got as high as 91. I think on some other exchanges it was even higher. And then reversed very sharply on very heavy volume. Somebody dumped a lot of coin on the market, probably in the leverage futures markets, and dropped it way below the breakout point. From there, it was worrying to me. I think I posted an alert that I was sort of lightening up on my long leverage position right in here. That was obviously the right thing to do because after three hours of kind of flagging, we had this big drop. And then that took me right here at the 8,400 area. It took me out of my remaining position. Still was a very good profit for my leverage position, but nothing like what it could have been if it had moved up. Point being, though, that this reversal back into the breakout zone in itself was not the problem. It was essentially this other piece here. And then I think the action sense. The action sense is telling me that we're flagging again. That's on the one hour. If I go out to a four-hour chart, this looks like a flag to me. It looks like it's actually breaking down right now as I record. So to me, I'm worried that this here becomes a bull trap, right? We had highs kind of a week or so before that. We exceeded those highs and then were slammed and trapped. And now I think we could be heading back down. Now we're looking at kind of this breakout point here. And that may be better. This area might be able to provide some support here in the 8,100 area. But unless we see a rally back over this weekend or even today to reclaim the 10, 20-day moving average, it's not over yet. But it's looking as if we have topped on the intermediate time frame. I'm going to go back out to a daily here. So here it is here. So we had this consolidation breakout. And then we had this failed second attempt right here. And now I think we're heading lower. What are the implications? Well, again, not over yet. We are still above the 20-day moving average. So markets, when they get kind of in this parabolic phase, do become very volatile. So it could be swinging either way, shaking people out on the bull side and the bear side. And we could move higher again. But my gut tells me from a tape reading perspective and just my experience trading that we have found the top right here. And I think in the end, we'll end up marking this maybe even as a left translator. So tops early, day 7, day 8 cycle. And then what we may be looking at here is a month or two of lower prices. Again, speculating here, just sort of speaking out loud. But we do have a massive move here to consolidate. And I've always said that once we find that top, eventually, wherever that might be, that we'll probably will have to grind lower for a very considerable amount of time just to consolidate those gains. Now, where does it go back to if that's the case? I think this cluster here or this area where it fell back in November is important. I think around the 64 to 6,600 area, which is a sizable drop from where we are. But I think that is where we ultimately find a resting place. But it may take some time. And it may even take a month and a half to get there. I don't know. We need to be patient. We had a great run at this point. If you've been long, a lot of the point, which you should have been, I think it's time to maybe start bringing some of those chips in and start cashing in, maybe start going to some USDT in trading accounts as well. I'm not saying rush out and short the entire thing. This is still a sort of a parabola kind of structure that has not necessarily broken down. If you look at it from a trend standpoint, it still is intact. Even if you look at this recent blue line here, if you extend it, you know, it still is a valid pattern. So not a time to be necessarily, like I said, panicking or going short. But it's certainly a couple of warning signs here that I'm concerned about. And I'm starting to bring in, obviously, brought in my leverage. So my trading accounts probably won't go into USDT personally. I think I still like to stay in BTC for now and let the market ride lower if need be. But I am looking to short this market right here and, you know, take advantage of possibly a move lower. Also, one other point I want to make, I talk about huddling positions a lot. I also have a YouTube channel where I do post free huddle type analysis, nothing to do with trading, just long-term stuff. I will never sell that long-term position until we're well into new all-time highs. So don't confuse when I say, you know, I'm selling or I've sold some positions here. It's all about trading and leverage positions only when it comes to what I post here on Bitcoin Live. And then lastly, as far as my kind of open positions here, Litecoin, Ethereum, XRP, they still look okay. Actually, they didn't get hit as much as I thought they would. And that's the one encouraging sign, at least for now. So Litecoin is one I want to sort of play for maybe a longer-term trend. So I'm giving this plenty of room to move around. And then same for XRP. I don't think that broke down a whole lot. Here it is here. So it's still above a 10 and 20-day moving average. And same for Ethereum. Had a little more of a wick, but actually closer to the stopper than the other two, but still looking okay. So for those, I will keep open, let them ride at this point. And then to see what Bitcoin is going to provide. I mean, look, Bitcoin has been so strong of late, it could recover from this potentially. But for me right now, it looks as if we want to be more defensive than offensive. We had a beautiful run to this point. It's been a very, very profitable, very good couple of few months, even though we haven't taken sort of too many trades. Just riding Bitcoin higher itself has been good. So let's just stay focused and happy trading.
