Good morning Bitcoin Live members it's Bob Lucas it is Monday morning in New York I hope you're all doing really well and had a great weekend gonna cover the Bitcoin cycle today and quickly go over what we could be looking at in the altcoin space unfortunately I think the kind of the bearish presentation I made last week is playing out as I expected we did not get a little bump as I thought we might get but we definitely are moving lower at this point we seemed to have kind of we seem to be breaking down now from this consolidation period that looks a little bit like a bear flag my concern was that after a big decline like we had last week on the 24th of February that we would after a period of consolidation continue the trend lower it certainly looks that way at the moment unfortunately I think the next real opportunity for Bitcoin to rise is going to be in the second half of this cycle I talked about how a 60-day cycle has you know two sort of halves to it we are now on day 26 of the cycle so we are approaching that midpoint and it's pretty logical now looking at this chart that we do have a day 18 high in place at least for the first half of this cycle and that we're now moving down into that first half cycle low of this 60-day cycle so I don't know where that takes us looking at the chart and you can kind of ignore this this was this is leftover from my last video where I was showing the bear the bullish opportunity that still is an opportunity right now but I'm just going to erase that for the time being and pretty much look at this and say okay day 26 we have roughly four days to a midpoint so anywhere between kind of today and next eight days we can expect kind of a half cycle low I think that half cycle low does not break down below this cluster of of candles that we had from the early portion of the cycle I think that will act as too much support in any type of decline but that's not that far far below that's only around 200 below so it could get exceeded on an intraday basis but I think what we're going to see now is sort of this move lower a couple of days maybe four days let's just say for argument's sake the midpoint 30 days then I think we get our rally in the second half of the cycle now based on the structure of this the way it looks I don't think it can exceed in this 60 day cycle the two current highs that we have showing here for 2019 well that's that one's late 2018 but but in the last sort of two months right I don't think we can exceed that we could it's a possibility and that would set the scene for a possible or for a likely right translated cycle meaning that we exceed the high exceeds the midpoint which means the next low would probably stay above this low and that would be a good start for potentially some good accumulation and then some gradual improvement over 2019 but for now I think we have to stay defensive we do have you know a huge downtrend behind us we still have 14 months of of sort of bearish prices we don't have solid or clear evidence that we have a new sort of you know that the bear market has ended or the four-year cycles and so we do have to stay defensive there's no way about it and that's also why I've been saying the last week I don't want to trade this environment this is a chopping environment trading this environment is only going to lead to for the most part a series of smaller losses that are going to start to add up very quickly and that's why I've stayed away I've kept my balance sheet clean there was no rule opportunity as far as I'm concerned what I was looking for if we were going to be really bullish was after a couple of days here in consolidation to rally up take out this day 18 high make another high and that would put me in a very bullish mindset at the moment I'm definitely leading more bearish but I also don't want to short because it's still only on day 26 of the cycle I only want to short from day 40 and beyond that's when the cycle is most likely to collapse that's where being short it can be rewarding and the surprises would more likely come to the downside I think what we're looking for again is the half cycle low decline I think then we rally back up we get people excited we exceed most likely exceed this Feb 28 candle that's sticking up and that high is 38.97 so let's just say 3,900 I think we end up between 39 and sort of 42 somewhere in this vicinity somewhere around day 40 let's just say and so let's just draw that in and then I think we start to chop and I think we move sideways then it all depends on where does this want to go right does it want to make a new low for the February cycle low does it want to sort of chop and and find support kind of in this lower 34 to 3600 area like the last cycle did if that's the case and that would become a very wide base of accumulation that could for the next cycle beyond April really help out and really provide the basis for the next sustained move which hopefully at that point will come up into the fourth higher four thousand dollar range even the five thousand dollar range again there's still a lot of work that needs to be done here it's not constructive enough for me to to be bullish in any way and again we need to see how Bitcoin responds coming out of the half cycle low into the second half of the cycle okay but otherwise I think it's still a bearish overall sort of a bearish look we would hope that this February the sixth low holds in the coming cycle low something like that okay that would be that would be fine you know that's just like I said many times we are in that sort of crypto bear market winter period even though we may be in a new four year cycle we're still in that I'm just accumulating phase there's still a lot of selling pressure still a lot of projects that are bleeding a lot of crypto a lot of ethereum a lot of cash they need to be selling what coins they have the miners are sort of struggling a little bit they need to keep selling there's just still a lot of pressure coming out of the bear market at the moment and there's still a lot of selling pressure here to be absorbed and that's something I've been talking about since the December lows right don't expect a massive rally at any point until we absorb all of this action I did say back in December that April is probably the cycle low even if it's not going to be a new price low it's probably the cycle low where things can maybe start to really improve and we start to get some upside momentum and where we can probably start to break out of this kind of range here from the lows 3100 up to sort of 4200 this area here a couple of cycles would be enough to paint a you know paint paint the chart and and complete the sort of accumulation for this stage to get it up into this next sort of zone here so that's what I'm looking at the moment again the markets can always surprise right we can always rally up from here break this day 18 high form a high in the day 30s or 40 range and that just changes the perspective or the picture entirely but until I see that I have to respect what I'm seeing on the chart I have to expect the price action respect the price action and therefore I just can't be long or even short at this point but I'm in definitely you know sort of a wait and see patience mode at the moment I prefer to be sitting in cash so to speak and in this case being in sort of a stable coin for example for my trading account right from a long-term perspective definitely fully invested I like this zone I don't think we get much more of a discount in waiting of course we could always get lower prices briefly in in April but long-term holders you should be fully invested at this point and then I'm going to quickly just go look at Ethereum all the old coins don't look great there are some exceptions of course but in general like Ethereum as I as I alluded here last week it's breaking down that tells me that the alts are going to lead down as well tells me that we're not ready to rally overall all right the space had its move here it is here it was big it was healthy but it was short-lived right and I always said in a bear market or in a negative sort of environment the rallies are short and steep and then you get the sell-offs right so that's where a left translated cycle is all about you get the you get a good third of a cycle then you get two thirds in a declining phase so we just need to be patient we need to work through this period the the light is definitely at the end of the tunnel but we still need to be more patient there's still more work to be done here it's going to take a little bit more time Ethereum to the dollar exactly as I had hoped or as I as I had shown didn't even get that little pop that I thought we would it's just rolled over clearly here this is a top of some type it's the half cycle top no doubt do we go into the half cycle low here do we rally back up and then where does it go from there okay that's the question looking at the structure of the chart you know I think we we probably roll over again just like I said for Bitcoin roll over in this sort of area right over here and then come down and form the cycle low I do believe though that this December low for Ethereum is going to hold I believe that's going to be the bear market low but again right if price comes down and takes it out then I accept it and I move on that's just the nature of trading okay it's good to have an opinion but let's not get let's not get too hung up on these sort of predictions or opinions especially like something like that where it doesn't necessarily matter from a trading standpoint I took a look at some of the other ones as well they're all kind of similar Litecoin is still holding up still the strongest of them all this would be a good buy at the next cycle low in April just as it was a good buy here even though it surprised everybody pretty much and and maybe left a lot of people behind and not being able to take a position but I think as it comes down into the April low Litecoin is going to be one of those one of those alts that you probably want to be long into the new cycle for sure just based on the way it's it's strength over the last two cycles at the moment okay so that's the update for this week I'll come out with a midweek update on Wednesday in two days time I'm actually going to post a public post probably this afternoon something I did on YouTube on sort of huddling and having a strategy for the really long term I just I just edited edited out that video I'm going to publish that as a public post so please look out for that as well otherwise I hope you're all doing really well leave some comments in the section below and I'm sure to get back to you as soon as possible all the best
