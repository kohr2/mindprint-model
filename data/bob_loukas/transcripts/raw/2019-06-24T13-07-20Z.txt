Hey, hello, Bitcoin live members. it's Bob Lucas on the 24th here on a Monday. hope you had a great weekend. this is your weekly Bitcoin cycles update. I'll cover Bitcoin on the daily, weekly and monthly chart. give you an idea of what could be going on. mostly, this has been a beautiful kind of 14 day run. in the last 14 days I think we only have two red candles, beautiful run from the June 10th period here where I look like Bitcoin was going to break down and maybe move lower, maybe back down to the 6,000 area here because we had moved so nicely off the February lows. but that was not to be. this candle here on June 14th for me was the the deal breaker. that's where I got long, because I did expect it to break down from here and it didn't, and the fact that it didn't meant to me that were going higher and that was the right choice. obviously, and looking back in hindsight, hopefully many of the members got on to the long leverage position I posted right here. it's now up two and a half thousand dollars since the post and I'm still long for half of that position. I will remain long as long as Bitcoin gives me a reason to stay long here and right now, as we hug the upper Bollinger bands and stay well above the 10 day and the 20 day moving average, I see no reason why I should be not in that position at the moment. obviously, I want to protect my gains as much as possible, and it's one of those, one of those games of keeping this stops wide enough in a big uptrend like this where you don't get caught in any given move sharply lower, temporarily at least, before going higher, but at the same time protecting enough of your profit. I think we've been a little fortunate because we don't have any of these bottom wicks- no real major shakeouts- at this point. sometimes you get this long sort of $1,000 wicks that take out even the most conservative of trading stops- not to be the case right here. looks like, though, I'm gonna be moving up my stop right now to the bottom of this candle here, around about the 10,050 area, looking for a little more upside first before doing that, but I think that's where the next stop is going to be right now. so giving it kind of a two day trading stop, two to three day trading stop, because we have a couple of very big candles here- the stop would be way, way too low here and giving up way too much open profit. so I think right now, getting to around the 10,000 levels of stop is the right thing to do. so. looking at the cycle here, day 38, day 38 since the last cycle- but I gotta, I gotta say, from a cycle standpoint, these aren't very clear at the moment because we have this really, really strong uptrend in play. we're not seeing very clear cut cycles and cycles are about the lows. a lot about the highs, cycles are about lows and when you have an uptrend like this, where the pullbacks are very, very brief and not very well defined, like we have now, it's hard to get really confident on these cycle lows. so right now I'm playing this more like a almost like a parabolic uptrend than I am anything else. the cycles here are more just a guide. they're not guide, they're not directing me very sort of specifically in my trading. I'm just trading the fact that this market wants to go higher, that it's hugging the upper bollinger bands, and then it seems like it's only pausing before uptrend. so we have- we all had one here where it didn't break down. we had an uptrend, we had a pause, sideways profit, taking consolidation up, pause, sideways up. so I'm just playing that at the moment, playing the trend, not getting, um, not getting sucked into this while the market's too overbought, it's too overextended, it's gonna crash. well, who cares? that's what stops it for. ride the major uptrend while it's available to you and then eventually, yes, it will end. eventually, yes, we won't even get a sideways move, we'll get a significant downtrend. but until that happens, there's no point in predicting anything but staying with the trend. so day 38, ideally around about a day 50 mark, is where the top would come in a nice uptrend. that's a nice right translated cycle. but, as I said before, gonna be a little, a little bit of a caveat with the cycles at the moment, just just ride the trend more than anything else. right here it looks like to me this wants to keep going higher. I've got a few days here over the weekend where it sort of tried to get above, comfortably above- the 11 000 area. it did briefly a couple times and pulled back. I think it's consolidating before more gains. I'm going to flip to a four hour chart so you can see what I mean on the four hour chart. so we had a consolidation here last week, a nice move. it looks like we may be consolidating again at the 10 bar moving average right here, just just above the 20 bar moving average for the four four hour chart. looks like we may want to chop for another day in this area and then maybe go up again. so again, respect the dominant trend. unless the dominant trend changes, there's no reason to believe that right now is the time where it's going to change. let it. let the price action confirm that it wants to change, but right now I'm thinking it's going higher. so the stop level would be right below kind of this big four hour candle, maybe just right on 10 000. in fact that's right below some of these wicks and that's enough room where, if it breaks down from here, gets back below 10 000. then there's a good chance that the move is over, the cycle has topped and it's also a chance that the that the major move from February is also over as well. we won't know if we won't know that for for for longer, for you need more of a decline for for that to be a sort of confirmed uh thing. but uh, any move below 10 000. at this point at least, let me go back to a daily any move below 10 000 i think brings us at least back into this 88 um area, maybe this area right here, and maybe then consolidates it goes higher again, meaning that the parabolic- parabolic like trend from February may not be over. i think that's only over when you sort of break down below- maybe these candles right here, let's put it online here- kind of below 75 means that it's over, but that may also be the bottom of of kind of the correction, because we're already looking at 11 000 down to 75. well, that's already sort of a 30 percent, looks like a 30 percent retracement. i'm just going to price that out real quick because we're already looking for 30. yeah, there you go. so, um, even a move back. and this is why i've been saying to the long-term folks: uh, don't be afraid to take a position in an uptrend like this, because look at this, even a 33 decline, which is all you'd expect as a correction in in a bull market, if we get a 33 correction, we're only back to price from two weeks ago. so, um, that just shows you the power of just getting a position and holding it in a major bull market, because a 33 decline would scare a lot of people, but only back to prices from three weeks ago. so just be aware of that, um. so for now, respect the uptrend. i'm going to go to a weekly chart and see if we have anything new to show you on the weekly. so here we are here: beautiful uptrend in play. uh, similar, at least, trajectory, um, um, than we had here, but doesn't seem anywhere near as speculative. this time. we don't have any of the um, any of the media attention: very little, uh, certainly no mainstream attention that i can hear of nobody's really coming up to me and and talking about like they did in 2017.. so what i think we're we're doing here is we're making this, and i said last week, before this candle looked like we were consolidating here and ready for a move, and it happened exactly like that from last week's report on monday, um, so i just want to keep staying in this position. uh, maybe, consolidate, go up, consolidate, go up. i think, maybe until we get to 18, 20 000, we're not going to have any action. it's possible that that's what this chart's doing right now. so stay denominated in bitcoin as much as you can, even when you're not trading, if you're not trading the alts. so, if you're not if you're sitting kind of idle and don't have a position or an opinion either way, just sit in and btc and take advantage of the spot price increase that we're seeing here, um, and then for the people that may think that these lows aren't, are not in for the bear market, then i, i think you're crazy. uh, i never want to say never, but in all my years of trading, i, i just would be so. so, um, i mean i would think bitcoin would be dead and crypto would be dead if, if it came back down and and got below 3 000 again. i just don't see on earth how that could happen. i think a really savage move and and the worst case move would be something where we sharply declined back to this uh, 6 400- 6 500 area, which is around about 44, decline that i can, i can accept and believe. um, that would also- i think i wouldn't call it help be healthy, but it'd be fine for me. it would shake out a lot of new people. but that type of move also would- all i believe would- come sharply lower and then sharply back higher. so it would be almost a v at this point: trapping people up in this area, shaking them out and then coming right back up very rapidly. okay, but that's not my prediction at this point. i think we're looking for the next 30 decline, like i said, maybe back to the the breakout point and then continuing higher, but this chart looks to me like it just wants to move higher. so who might, who might, predict something, uh, other than than that at this point? like i said, some points going to turn, the market will consolidate. we may get some six months of chopping or sideways action, but this move right now is moving higher. and then, on the monthly, there it is right, there that's just, um, hang on, hang on. that was not the monthly, this is the monthly, and on the monthly we just have, well, it looks like this is a just a little blip right here in in a major secular bull market looking back from 2012, it just looks like this is continuing again. the 10 month moving average is starting to turn higher. we are priced way above the 10 month moving average. so, uh, this looks like it just wants to go now and just keep making that move higher. so just be aware of the power of this, of this chart just going. this is a six- sorry, this is a seven year chart, and if you don't think this is extremely bullish, then you need to. you take another, closer look at this. just don't discount the power of this type of chart that we're seeing here and just make sure you're allocated long term wise as well to take advantage of this move. all right, so that's the update for this week. pretty simple, straight to the point. we've made some really solid gains. hopefully you've been along for that ride. still leverage long. still obviously fully allocated spot long. the old coins have done nothing against btc. i'm glad to be mostly, or just about, out of everything. even from a long-term standpoint, very much reduced positions. for now the action is with bitcoin. there will be an opportunity again. all coins will go, will do well at some point and when they do, we'll see that the chart and we'll be behind a little bit. that's fine, because being ahead means that you're losing, like now. if you're trying to get ahead of these moves in all coins- and you've been losing a lot- we're being cut to death by continuous lower lows on the all coins versus btc. i don't want a part of that. until i see uptrends in place, then i'll pivot and i'll rotate some of the bitcoin into all coins and see if we can increase our btc position as well when that happens. all right, so hopefully you enjoyed that. leave me any questions that you have and i'll be be back on wednesday. all the best.
