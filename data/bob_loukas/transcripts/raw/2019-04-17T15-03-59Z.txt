Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas. It is Wednesday morning here in New York on April the 17th. I hope you're doing really well. This is your midweek update on Bitcoin, and we'll go over some of the other coins and developments. Not a whole lot of change since Monday in the report. We've actually, though, moved back above the 10-day moving average. Overall, this action to me is very constructive and very positive. I don't think we're talking about anything sort of major in terms of upside, but I do see most of the strength coming beneath the market and suggesting to me that we're still in the early portion of the cycle and that price wants to move higher. So I do feel there's a lot of accumulation still going on in here and that we're comfortably holding the initial breakout point from a couple of weeks ago. And that to me tells me that Bitcoin wants to remain in this sort of 4,200 to 5,800 zone and start to fill in a lot of this gap here over the next coming few cycles before making the next move higher into the $6,000 range. So this is really positive, I think, for us who are holding more from an intermediate time frame or a longer time frame, don't ignore the strength here. You don't want to be looking for a pullback to be adding to positions. You want to have and be fully invested for what you plan to hold for at least kind of the remainder of this year or even next year, right? So if you're still light from the longer term allocation, I urge you to not discount the possibility that we do see a really big surprise. And by that, I mean something that actually does go up into this sort of $7,000 range. Not my expectation at the moment, not my primary thought, but you know, Bitcoin is such a unique asset. This whole sector is so unique that it's not unlikely, I guess. And maybe more likely than, for example, coming back down and testing the $3,000 range. I would probably, if I had to be a betting man, I would say this is more of a possibility than coming back down. So keep that in mind. If you're, you know, one of those investors, longer term focus people here, just be aware of that. If you're trading this, then we're going to have opportunities on the upside and the downside. Right now, I think the, the, the, I think Bitcoin is more likely to move up into this $5,800 zone than it is to come down. I see this recent two week action as just consolidation of this big, really big candle here. And the acknowledgement that Bitcoin broke out of this consolidation triangle period since the four, four year cycle low. So we're consolidating. And for that reason, I do believe we are more likely now in the coming weeks to see Bitcoin sort of start to maybe consolidate a little bit more, but then actually come up and do a test of that 58, 5,900, maybe even go up to sort of 6,200 area, and then form a cycle high and then come back down. Okay. Um, the longer it moves sideways in this 4,200 to 5,800 zone, the more likely it is that we're going to hold this area. And then in the coming cycle low, not breach below kind of the top here at 4,200 or even kind of this line here that I've drawn intersecting these prior two cycle highs, it would be more likely that Bitcoin would come and bounce back off that level. And that at this level now provides support for the market. Okay. So that it all depends on being able to form more of a right translated cycle here over the next few, maybe three to four weeks, meaning that it needs to spend more time going higher in general. And with the eventual peak coming at least in the, by the midpoint of the, of the cycle, the one problem we have with cycle clarity is the last cycle low. We don't have a clear marking like we have, we've had for the last three years. And this happens every now and then I tried to explain that on previous videos that we have a short consolidated cycle low here, not by a price, but by a time. And none of the indicators really show it's significant cycle low with each, um, the smoothed out, uh, D trended, uh, pattern only came halfway down, but this is the closest thing we have to kind of a detended low, which is right in the middle here. Uh, I'm taking an actual price low right here, and that could be day 47 cycle low. And then the last bar before the breakout day 54, any one of these, and it's not really any one day that forms a cycle low in this case, it's more just this cluster in this area where it should have turned lower and it didn't, and it didn't because the selling pressure eventually became exhausted and it was too, and it was met by an equally and more impressive buying, uh, support in this market here. So instead of rolling over, like everybody thought it would after this initial December decline, it actually broke higher and reversed. So that's why we have the kind of this, uh, it's not abnormality, but it's, it's more of a unique cycle low point being is that if we measure the cycle low, let's just say for argument's sake around March 28th, if we go 30 days out, we're looking at around about April 28th. Okay. So April 28th is only right here at this point. So let's put that up here. So April 28th is the midpoint of the next 60 day cycle. So from this midpoint to the next midpoint, the cycle low then should be around about May 28th. Okay. So April 28th, 30 days, April 28th, sorry, let me repeat March 28th cycle low, April 28th mid cycle, May 28th and next cycle low. So if that's the midpoint, if we can form a cycle high past that midpoint and that becomes right translated, becoming right translated means in general that we are in an uptrend. Okay. And that we are now filling in this higher price, which means I said, I suspect that the next cycle low again, as I said before, holds the prior cycle highs and that's how you maintain and continue to see an uptrend in a market where we have a continuous cycle highs that are going cycle lows that are moving higher and the cycle highs are also higher in price. And that's that up, up sort of stepping process that you see. Now, again, I think there's still going to be one big surprise guys. And I think it may become probably, so looking at May and then you're looking at June and July. So some point July and August in this area here, I think we get a surprise and that could look something like, and this is going to be a relatively um, sort of crude drawing here. So don't look at it, you know, price by price, but we think, I think we kind of get something like that fails to go up. And then here's where it really scares everybody breaks below this cycle low comes down and does, I wouldn't call it a retest of December lows, but shakes everybody out $2,000 drop. This to me becomes kind of the final scare of the bear market or final, uh, you know, final washout, uh, on, on, on fast price and high volatility before then moving up. And then, you know, eventually obviously moving up to, to make new highs and then put the entire bear market behind us. Now, does this analysis contradict what I said to start the video where you should have a full position on the surface? It does. But when you consider, like I said before, that this is only a scenario and that in the end, my main and firm belief is that by the latter part of the year, or even maybe by December of this year, we're going to see price up in the seven, eight, $9,000 range, or certainly well above this resistance at 58 to $6,000. Then that's how I'm looking at it for the longer term holders. I'm looking at, well, if the price and, and if, and if price is very likely to be up there, then don't risk your position now to get a lower price when in fact, uh, we may not get any of this. Okay. It's not a guarantee. It's just how I've seen bear markets form in the past. I like to see, um, I like to see them come back and do a sort of a big double test. And I don't think February was a double test at all. This is just an uptrend here. So I want to see that it's not a guarantee. Okay. So don't, don't get in the situation where this happens. Okay. And you're still waiting for this down here or down here in August. And that just keeps going. That's why I'm just warning you now traders. Of course, we're going to take, and we're going to trade probably short this on the way down and long this, and then short this. That's what we do as traders. We change our opinion quickly and often, and we try and take advantage of all the wiggles and all the short term trends that we see in the market as they present themselves. Right now, I really don't see a short term trend for you to trade. Um, we could, or you could look at going long here and taking advantage of this being still, still ahead of us, perhaps because we are in the early sort of stage of the cycle. Um, maybe, maybe your lows here, uh, this bottom can, okay. That's the lowest candle in Alaska, a week or two that has a low of around 49, 12. So maybe a low of around 4,900 that's possible. That's around about a seven or 8% move lower. You can take a position there, ride this up here, risk reward. It's not huge. You're probably talking about 15, 20% higher versus, uh, 8% lower. So kind of like a two to one, um, probably, you know, could be worth it for some of you, but again, this isn't something you're going to get leveraged up on or risk a lot. You're going to manage your risk. You may take a long position. And the reason why you may want to do that also is that we may get an overshoot to the upside. If you get an overshoot to the upside, you may be able to take advantage of that if you had a pretty strong position in hand as well. Okay. So that's the analysis on Bitcoin. I'm going to cover Ethereum because I think there's still maybe a little more opportunity there on Ethereum. Uh, so let's look at that chart. So I'm now out of this position. I had my stop really tight here at the 150. I used this bottom candle here, 158 level, uh, out of that now with two days ago, it came down to 156. So I'm just watching at the moment, but I think now that if you look at this a little closer, you had the top here, and then it seems like we've had a decline. This here never served as sort of a new, a new high. So we have kind of one big decline all the way down to this, uh, 156 low. So the 156 low is back below the breakout point and now it's back above. So potentially here we could be going long again. I'm thinking about it. What's holding me back is that it has not yet pierced the 10 day moving average and, and that 10 day moving average is beginning to almost, um, move lower. Now it's sort of holding the 20 day, which is good. So I want to see this move higher. So what I'm thinking here as a strategy for me is that these two candles here, so the highs are 169 and 169. So about the 170 level, if we can get above the 170 level, then we move and make sort of a new high or we make what's called a swing low. So here's the low on this candle. If we move above the high of that candle, that becomes what's called a swing low. And we would exceed the 10 day moving average, which sets up the possibility that Ethereum will or could then begin to make strides higher and actually continue the breakout pattern that we have here with this ascending triangle. Um, I'm willing to take that trade. If we see the evidence that there's some strength, I don't want to just take it right now because at the moment it is acting a little weak or it's not acting strong enough for me to say that that pattern is in effect. So be aware I move above 170.5, let's call it that 170 50. I would get long this again. And then the 156 here low becomes, uh, it becomes my stop. I want to size the trade accordingly. I don't want to be risking more than probably like 0.75 on this one. Um, because it has come back and failed or at least stopped me out once I second time around. I want to be a little more cautious and also the reward possibility on something like this up to say like a two 30 as the chart indicates or two 40 even is significant enough where I don't want to risk too much anyway, because I will be rewarded if it's right. So that's important. You want to be weighing the reward with the risk and then saying to yourself, well, if it's such a huge payoff, well, why risk so much? And that's also the same type of idea people should have and sorry, not to digress here, but when we're looking at Bitcoin from a very long perspective out two or three years and we're thinking Bitcoin 50 80 or 200,000, like I'm thinking, then it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to be betting or risking huge or vast sums of your wealth on something like that. When if it, if, if, if it pans out, then you're going to be doing really well, even with a very small position in general, kind of same philosophy here is that on this type of one trade, if the opportunity is very big, then, uh, there's no need to necessarily over leverage over risk as well. I covered the OS midweek. Uh, I still like this chart. I think this here is consolidating here to go higher. Uh, you, you always want to be long the strongest of the asset classes. We have a very, very definitive bottom here. I mean, price is already up 300% to 300%. So I do like this. You can see a huge consolidation cluster at this level here back last year and it broke down. I think now what it's doing here is trying to get above, if you look at that, it's almost a near perfect, um, spot. And it did when it broke down. So it may actually move sideways for longer because of that, but in general, this is a nice uptrend and has a clear higher lows, higher highs. So this year is a long counter for you and something you can take as an opportunity. Litecoin is similar. Litecoin against BTC. I haven't covered too much against BTC, these assets because BTC is also moving higher. So they're showing kind of flat chart patterns, but against the dollar, we see a lot of these showing really bullish patterns. Litecoin versus BTC here has had a nice consolidation. Come all the way down, starting to look a little risky here that it may want to break down back down to at least this sort of rising trend line. But I do like where it stands right here. I think if you, if you want to get a position or wanting to get a position for the intermediate term, then this is a nice pullback and a healthy spot to get back in. From a trading standpoint, I think we want to see a reversal first and get back above the 10 day moving average, then put a stop below this level here. Right now it's looking kind of toppy. The, the, the alternative argument is that, Hey, your stop is so low anyway, that why not take a long position and see if it does hold. That's one way to look at it. But, um, I think there's a very high chance it would get stopped out, stopped out based on this. So you would have to take that trade knowing that you would get stopped down again. It's very, very minimal risk if you do something like that. And then Litecoin versus the dollar, this one, as you can see, same as EOS looking more bullish against the dollar looks like we have kind of a pennant consolidation here. Um, liking that idea. And if you look at the trend higher, then it looks like you've got, you know, a number of recent sort of lows in here consolidation. And this could be another one here and looking to go higher again. So this one looks very positive to me as well. Okay. My friends, I hope you've enjoyed the update on Friday. I'll come out with a full lightning report covering 35 or so coins looking out for that, not a whole lot of movement in the altcoin space. So let's see if there is some movement, uh, between now and then to, to report on. Otherwise, um, we'll go through the motions as we always do each week. If you have any requests, as always, please add them, any comments, put them below. I'm happy to engage in any discussion, wishing you a happy trading week and speak to you soon.
