Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Wednesday the 19th. This is your top 10 market cap report. And today we start with Bitcoin as we always do looking at some pretty impressive action here over the last three or four days. In particular, since it broke out of this, this little what will look like a flag before breaking down, it broke higher right here where it snapped the 10 day moving average with some authority to me tells me that Bitcoin still wants to go higher, made new highs here. I think it's taking a little bit of a break or pause after moving above the Bollinger Bands for a couple of days. If the continuation in the cycle is higher, which I think it probably is because we did not find a new low in this area, looks like we're in around about day 30 of the cycle. So from here, what we could be looking at is, let me get my drawing tool, sort of a pullback maybe over a day or two to the 10 day moving average, bouncing off that and then continuing that move higher. And then that could go for another sort of 10 trading days, maybe even 15. 15. And that, in my opinion, has the potential to get up towards around about the 12,000 to 12,500 area, probably in the best case scenario. And that is based purely on the idea that we're getting something like this or sort of something like this after consolidation. So as we begin to break out here, the Bollinger Bands, and we begin to create some separation from the 10 day moving average, looks like we could be looking at a big run higher. Now, again, all depends on if this is a consolidation before another move higher. Also depends a lot on the idea if I zoom out that we're in, I wouldn't call a parabolic trend, but certainly a significantly sort of steep uptrend here that began all the way back really with his February low that did not form as a new lower or double bottom from here just moved higher. And really, this is a start, in my opinion, of the rally where the amount of buyers in the market just simply outpaced or outstripped the amount of supply that was coming in. I think supply in this area was exhausted, a lot of accumulation in this range here. And then once price was allowed to go higher, there was more of a rush to get access. That continued all the way here until April the 1st. And this here was definitely the recognition bar where there was just no more sellers left in the market, only buyers. And then ever since then, we've had this move. So I think right here, we're looking at a continuation of this entire move from March or even February. I don't believe that has ended just yet. When it does end, that's when we're going to get that 30% correction, maybe even a 40% correction. I know that sounds really significant, but you know, a 40% or 30% correction is around about $3,000 to $4,000. Even at today's prices, a correction back to the $6,000 range is probably not the end of the world at all, right? On the chart, at least it wouldn't look too significant. So I think while this uptrend is in play and we have higher highs and higher lows on the cycle counts, we respect this possibility. And from a trading standpoint, obviously always long with positions, always positioned in Bitcoin when not trading. At the moment also leveraged long through the futures account. And that stop here at the moment is set below this bar here, around about $8,600. I think anything below that, then we start to start to give up some of the profit that's already there. And then also it could, it would be below the 10 day moving average, and I think rolling over. So that's where I'm set for now, just letting, letting the market dictate where it wants to go and positioned with what is the trend. And we're at the moment, it's clearly on the upside. So nothing else to be had here in Bitcoin, just let the market continue to move higher. We're in the $9,000 range. I mean, who would have thought just three or four months ago, right, that price would be at $9,000. If I told you in February or March, that in just sort of eight to 10 weeks, or in 10 weeks time, we'll be at $9,000, you'd think I was absolutely crazy. So stop fighting that trend, stop fighting, or stop being scared of a big pullback. Big pullback will come eventually. But just stay with the trend and the primary trend. We're in a new four year cycle. And there's no reason to be afraid of this market. It's only reason to be positioned with it, and let the tide take you along. All right, let's move over to Ethereum. And this is the reason why we use stops, of course, right. So once, even though I think I even got up before the stop, but once a chart is not showing the kind of behavior you're looking for in the setup, then most likely it's going to break down like this one did for Ethereum. This is Ethereum versus BTC. Obviously, BTC is stronger than all the assets right now. The money wants to go into BTC. I think a lot of people aren't as concerned about buying a lot of these altcoins. I think a lot of these projects are also maybe getting tired. I mean, you know, Ethereum has been talking about Ethereum 2.0 for years now. I've been talking about proof of stake for years. It keeps getting delayed. I'm not sure if the market's respecting them anymore as a solution or as a platform. So I think a lot of that's going on right here. But then when you look at Ethereum from a dollar standpoint, this here looks bullish. Looks like we have a pretty big flag. I know Excel, the other contributor on the site, had a really nice post about this biz flag here. And I definitely agree. It looks like we're going higher. But I think this is only a function of BTC going higher. As BTC goes higher and all these other assets at least maintain somewhat of a peg to BTC, then when you value these against the dollar, they're going to be higher as well. So I think, so I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't know if many of these altcoins go higher versus the US dollar unless BTC is moving higher as well. So it's more of a function of BTC, which is why I want to be in the strongest of asset classes in an uptrend and not the ones that are lagging like many of these are. So anyway, if you are trading against the dollar, if you're on some of these accounts where you're trading against the token or this sort of stablecoin, then yes, this does look pretty good. I think we definitely have kind of the bottom of the Bollinger Bands here as your stop point. But you want to be more aggressive than that. You look at this 20 day moving average slightly below that. So sort of the 250 area, anything below that is kind of a danger that this could be breaking down. But this does look like it wants to move higher. And there is quite a bit of room above, to be honest, if you look at this, this the part of the post here of a flag pattern, then you probably measure this out from 140 to 250. Then you're looking at around about a $380 price target on a break higher of this flag pattern. So overall against the dollar looks pretty good. But again, against BTC, I'm not seeing this type of strength that gets me excited at all. All right, moving on to Ripple. I posted something on Twitter yesterday that got a lot of attention, got a lot of people angry at me. Ripple has a huge, passionate fan base. And I sometimes question their belief in a lot of what's really going on mechanically with Ripple. But I won't get into that right now. They did post something about an acquisition or an investment in MoneyGram or something like that. Supposed to be very bullish news. But the chart did nothing, zero. So I'm out of this from a trading standpoint. Got out a little early, I think it was on this one. But either way, it still went right below kind of this low from here. So as far as I'm concerned, we have a high, so a low, high, higher low here. But then this high here did not make a higher high. And now we have a higher, sorry, a lower low at this point. So it looks like we are changing trend again, or we're just continuing this larger degree trend down. So I'm not bullish at all on XRP. I know a lot of people are. Of course, XRP has a history of doing this type of thing where it just doubles kind of in three or four trading sessions. I wouldn't be surprised at any time with Ripple doing that. But I just don't see how that becomes a trading or investing narrative waiting for one of these pumps or one of these sort of spikes in price. For me, I like to look at a longer term chart. And when you look at this longer term chart, you really have to go back to September of last year where it did anything. And again, that was just this spike. So it was a four or five session wonder and nothing else. And ever since then, it's essentially pretty much just declined lower and is down, you know, 50, 60% versus BTC. So right here, it looks like it's rolling over again. As far as I'm concerned, this looks like it's going to move down and make new lows against BTC. And of course, people wanted to point out that against the dollar, it's doing better. But again, I think this is just a function of Bitcoin and the market and the dollars that are flowing into Bitcoin. That's, that's elevating everything up. So yeah, against Ripple, probably have like another flag pattern going on here as well. And that looks like it could be somewhat of a continuation pattern from this post here. So it looks like it could move higher from here up into this area. So that's something to pay attention to from from a dollar cross or dollar pair perspective. Bitcoin cash versus the dollar is breaking down, is looking like it wants to go lower, tested the lows that we saw back in April and in May. This looks like it still wants to go lower. And for that reason, I would not want to be in this, I would want to be short. Looks like we could be looking at a move like this, that comes back down and settles back into this area here. That's the next level of support, maybe a little bit of a support area right in here at the point zero four level. But ultimately, it looks like this wants to head back down into this area. Again, I don't like this project. This is purely for trading Bitcoin cash. I think the project, in my opinion, is dead in the water. But others disagree, of course, and that's what makes a market. But from a trading standpoint, right now, even I don't see where the opportunity is. So for me, this is an avoid. EOS is a little similar to Litecoin. This one also is breaking down, finding sort of new lows as it goes down. I think the best case is that it's looking to come back down to this area. But as far as I'm concerned, when you look at it from a longer term picture, it looks like it's in a downtrend now and could make it all the way back down into this 6500 area or even all the way back down. I just don't know because you look at this structure, you've got this uptrend to here, you've got this sort of trap area here, slightly higher high, big decline, then almost like a right shoulder or at least an attempt to get back up there, didn't make these other peaks and now it's back down. So in theory, I think we're going to break down and probably head back down into this area here before finding a stable bottom. Again, then we look at against the US dollar, looks like it looks a lot different, doesn't it? And again, don't be fooled by all this. This is not, there's not all these assets saying people are buying this from the US dollar perspective. Money is not flowing into these, they're going into Bitcoin. And some of these coins are declining versus Bitcoin, but Bitcoin's far exceeding the US dollar. And that's why versus the dollar pair, you're still seeing these go up. All right, Litecoin. So I think Litecoin now is at a do or die type moment with a halving coming up in sort of two months. This pump here was pretty significant and the retracement here has been pretty significant as well. I think it's shaking out a lot of people. We now went back just slightly below the 20 day moving average. I think this here now is the moment that Litecoin needs to needs to show us that it wants to continue the rally. This was deep enough as it is that concerns me. I normally want to see the 20 day moving average hold. The only reason why I'm giving it some little bit of leeway is because it is a volatile asset. It has a halving coming up. It has a lot of attention behind it. So I want to give it that sort of chance. But this now is a hard stop with these two candles. If we get back down below these lows here at 0.0142, let's say, then at that point, it's time to get out. Especially now that it's come back a little bit. If it comes back down, then that's sort of a continuation of this larger pattern lower. And anything lower down like this is way too deep and the 10 day would be really swinging lower at that point. And that to me is not the definition of an uptrend. That to me is a local top and I want to get out of the position by then. But still hoping that that's not the case, that we're looking at sort of this higher, two new highs and then it off going off to make highs maybe at the 0.02 level and above. Okay, Binance Coin against BTC, not a whole lot here. That gets me excited. I mean, back above this level, then I'd like to see, I would likely maybe get back in from a trading standpoint, but nothing here that I like from a trading standpoint. From a long term standpoint, obviously, I think this big uptrend is still in play, but versus BTC is not as clear anymore. Obviously against the dollar, it's very clear and looks like with this tightening of the Bollinger Bands that we will get another move higher. It looks like it's ready to break out. So against the USD, this looks really good. And I think you want to be long, something like this. I don't trade against the USD, it's a pair. So for me, it's not an option. But this does look good to me. I think it's ready to move higher. Got a nice tight stop here just below probably the 20-day moving average. One of these wicks, one of these candles here offers a good stop. But this looks like it wants a move higher. So this is something that you could trade. I have a long-term position in this. I've held for a very long time. And I still want to hold that even though they have announced that they're going to be restricting US traders, at least on the traditional Binance platform. They'll have to trade, US traders have to trade on a US-based platform. I think that's going to hurt revenues. But in the end, these coins aren't based on revenue. They're not like traditional businesses where they're looking at profit or EBITDA or cash flow or anything like that. These tokens are utility. And as long as people are trading on these platforms, then these coins should do well as well. So I'm still bullish overall on this. Probably starting to or probably will consider this starting to take some of my profit in this longer-term position only because I think this now Binance is worth something like 8 billion or 10 billion. And that's a lot for an exchange when we see a lot of exchanges come and go. It seems like every year there's kind of one exchange that is the dominant exchange. So it's very difficult to maintain your leadership and your market share in this industry. So you don't want to necessarily be caught holding the bag on something like this, especially after a almost a 10x, well, pretty much a 10x, almost a 10x move from the bottom here just in December. I knew it was right to be bearish on XLM for many, many months. Don't like this project anymore. Don't like the way coins are being issued or given away. And this chart, I think, reflects everything about that. I mean, it would look great last year, how it was holding up. But ever since, it's just been in a massive decline. Looks like it wants to find the lows from May, but I think it's going to go lower than that as well. So again, nothing really I like about this. And then also from a dollar standpoint, don't trade this. Even though it looks like it may be flagging here for a move higher, there are so many other coins I've showed you today that look so much nicer than this. Even even Ripple looks a lot better than this in the dollar standpoint, but Ethereum looks much better. So does Litecoin and so does even the OS. So I think you want to avoid Stellar at all costs from a Bitcoin pair and a dollar pair as well. So yeah, almost tired of waiting for ADA to do anything. It had that nice run in March. We took advantage of that. That was a good profit, but right now not doing anything like the other ones, kind of back to test this May lows. And to me, that tells me they want to go even lower at some point. So I don't like anything about this. I'm sorry. And let's see against the dollar. Again, a little better against the dollar. Looks like we have tight bands here. The trend is up, but only slightly up. I don't think you want to be trading this one, even though it doesn't look too bad. I think you want to be trading Ethereum and some of the other ones I pointed out that have even nicer charts. Now, this is much better than the Stellar chart I just showed you, but overall, I think there's better opportunity with some of the other coins. And lastly, looking at Tron, same picture again versus BTC breaking down, tried to break higher and has now popped back into this long, long-term channel dating back to August. Nothing I like about this from a trading standpoint. And then versus the USD looks a lot better. Of course, I think some of the other ones did look better, but you do have an opportunity here with this sort of somewhat of a breakout and now it's sort of consolidating, looking to move higher as the boulder bands get tighter. I think this candle here is your stop about 10% lower. This could be a trade long, but again, I think I like some of the other ones I mentioned earlier in this piece from a US dollar pair perspective. I think in the end, looking back at the Bitcoin chart, this chart to me is where the money is for now. I think all coins will have their day again, maybe sooner than later, but for now, this trend remains in place. This is where the money is flowing. This is where the profit and the target, this is where the profit is as far as I'm concerned. So this is where I want to be mostly focused on for the time being. Hope you enjoy this top 10 report. If you have any comments as usual, please put them below. I'll be checking frequently and any coin requests you have for the next lightning report, please add them as well. Thank you very much.
