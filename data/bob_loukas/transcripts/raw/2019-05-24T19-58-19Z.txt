Hello, Fintap members. It's Bob Lucas. It is Friday around 3.30 p.m. in New York. I hope you're doing really well. I'm going to cover the weekend report via video this week again. Getting ready to get out actually for the long weekend, have some guests visiting from out of town. And to be honest, there's not a whole lot of change since yesterday morning's midweek update. So I'm going to cover this weekend's report via video in a little more detail than I would normally do via video. See if we can come up with any hints here. But I've got to be honest with you, there's a lot of, I guess, confusing counts. And counts that can go in multiple ways. And that's why I'm basically mostly out of the market at the moment from a short-term perspective at least. Long-term, still fairly well invested outside of kind of what I cover in my report. Still see no reason why I should not necessarily be invested for the long-term. But there are some warning signs. Let's start with gold first. So gold on the daily cycle standpoint here has really thrown us for a little bit of a loop because we had a nice move in the beginning of the daily cycle, broke the declining trend line. This candle in particular here, which broke the trend line, also really launched off the 10-day moving average, which had already crossed above the 20. So really all the signs were there. Swing low, above the 10-20, 10-20 cross, declining trend line cross. Everything is in place here for a first daily cycle. And the fact that gold was already in sort of a late 30-plus week count. So not unexpected. Went long here because of that. But then we had this kind of nasty action here last, well, this week, earlier this week, but also last week. And initially I'm thinking, well, it could just be a half cycle low decline. But typically a half cycle low will not come this far back. Certainly will not retrace all the way back where it's almost making a double bottom or new lows. So this to me, perfectly honest with you, is confusing. It still could be and probably will be part of the first daily cycle. But it may be one of those cases where we get one of these sort of flat, even left translate. It doesn't happen that often or maybe like a double top. But, you know, a left translative cycle that ends up being, in hindsight, very difficult to mark in terms of does it associate with a prior ending portion of the cycle? Or is it part of the, is it a first cycle, part of, part of the investor cycle? So what I mean is if we mark here, for example, this becomes a left translated cycle, but it does not make a new low. So you end up, you end up with a situation like this, for example, okay, where to the naked eye and to a lot of people following cycles, they say, well, it didn't make a new price low. So it's part of the first daily cycle. I tend to look at those situations as part of the ending portion of the prior investor cycle and that we kind of form this time-based ICL and final daily cycle low before moving higher. As you know, whenever that happens, it does move to the upside rapidly. So we are on a lookout for something like that, where we kind of got this consolidation and accumulation at the same time, where you've got selling pressure, but it's being held up with support. I don't know if that's necessarily the case right now in gold, but you would think with maybe geopolitical risks and also maybe the market coming to the end of a long bull market cycle, that there could be a lot of underlying accumulation occurring here in gold. And you're seeing maybe some of this here with gold really holding itself up whenever coming under pressure. Again, we still need to see this cycle unfold before that's even a reality. But I just want you, the reason I'm pointing out is mostly because of the way this is reacting right now. It looks like it wants to chop sideways for longer, and it's going to be difficult to determine again whether this is the first cycle or the last cycle of the one that's started all the way back in August of last year. I think the takeaway is that there really isn't much of a trade here that I can see. Even if it does break down and form a failed cycle, meaning it drops below this May 2nd candle at the 1266 level. Let's draw that in quickly and give you an idea of what I mean here. I'll go with green. So if it does break down like this, then we're already talking about day 20, I would say, day 22 in the cycle. And for a late cycle, that's more than enough for a turn. So because we've progressed sideways mostly for 12 or 13 days already, any breakdown lower is not as short in my opinion, because I think we could be looking at one of these new lows for a couple of days and then reverse higher. So that's the other option. So I don't think I want to see anything or go with anything short at this time. The other alternative is that we just go higher from here. I don't see that as a possibility at this point, just again, by the way this is reacted. But if it does, then I think I would want to buy this breakout right here, even though maybe by the same logic, you know, it's deep into a timing band. I think if it goes higher, then we're looking at a first daily cycle for sure. And we know that those can rally up to day 30 before topping, even day 32 or day 33. So because we have so much, I wouldn't call it pent up energy, but we have seen one, two, three cycles lower, any break or surprise move higher from here. I think we want to buy it quickly because we run the risk of the market really getting away from us at some point and not being able to get back in easily. It has happened before during really big moves on the upside where, you know, you kind of say, let me wait for the first daily cycle load occur, but it rallies for 36, 37 days and you don't get a chance to get back in. So there is a chance that it could just do, you know, something like this all the way up within the one cycle, all the way up to the recent highs around 30, you know, 1360 or so. And we won't give you a chance to get back in. And then the DCL becomes pretty shallow again. Those are the scenarios I'm looking out for right now. Again, no real trade unless we can get back above this area here, back above the recent highs on May 14th. We're not short a low and in fact, I would want to buy long. If we can drop down and make one more lower low, then we definitely are still part of this long 40, almost 40 weeks by that point, investor cycle. And I would want to buy that reversal and swing. That gives us even more potentially, potentially a better entry point and more confirmation that this would be a first daily cycle and that could potentially rally by $100 or more. So flipping to the weekly, and this is where it gets confusing because, I mean, if you look at this, this is already 40 weekly candles since the last real cycle low. And gold has been, even really for the last 10 years, super consistent on its cycle low markings from a week 20 to 26, 28 level. Rarely has it gone into the week 30 range. It did recently a couple times, 30 here and 35. But it has been very consistent. And this to me is confusing. And then what's more confusing here is that we had this candle higher, which looked like it was definitely going to be a start of a new cycle, a break of the trend. But if you notice, it really hasn't broken the trend. Well, it depends on how you draw it, of course, right? But it really hasn't, at least not yet, broken out with authority for me to say that for sure we're in a new cycle. The only thing that tells me I want to be looking for a new cycle is the fact that we're on week 40 and it's overdue. But, you know, once it became kind of an outlier in the sense that it was already running very, very extended from a weekly count, I begin to ignore that count for that very reason. It's an outlier. And outliers tend to really surprise. And that's a reason why they're an outlier to begin with. So the fact that we're on week 40 now, I just don't know. I mean, maybe it's maybe possible that we're seeing two weekly investor cycles in one here. So, you know, we could be seeing a sideways chop for another, let's just say, eight weeks that gets us to two kind of long, two regular cycles. Again, let me see if I can, you know, maybe we get a drop and maybe we kind of get this chopping action and then we get a drop and that becomes a very recognizable kind of cycle. That's probably too far out as well. But you get the point. Let me see if I can just stop that. So let's just clean this up a little bit. So maybe into kind of the July, late July, which is kind of two months from here, which would be around about eight weeks. You know, it's possible you get something like that and then this becomes, you know, kind of like a double cycle at some point. Again, very hard to tell. We just have to let the market and the price tell us where it wants to go and what it's doing exactly. But when I zoom out, I still feel bullish about this market. It has now been declining for 12 weeks and hasn't caused a whole lot of damage. It's still hanging off the 10-week moving average. Whereas if you saw or if you look at previous cycles that decline, look at this one here. I mean, it was just red, red, red, red all the way down, hugging the lower Bollinger Bands. Here it looks like we're starting to develop tightening of the bands. And that's why I'm thinking we may even get sort of this sideways chopping action for a little longer, false breakdown, shake out, and then go up and test this really big neckline and resistance area that I think eventually will break and see gold move higher. So, you know, short-term, guys, really nothing to, you know, no edge, I guess is what I'm saying. Need to see this pan out. Got to think you want to lean a slightly bearish still only because we don't have that upside confirmation just yet and that we're still closing the weeks below the 10-week moving average. We haven't had a close above the 10-week moving average. I think one of these here was a close, but that was before we had pure confirmation that the cycle was definitely in decline. So it's been around eight weeks since we've even come close to closing above the 10-week moving average. Until we can close above a 10-week moving average, it is very difficult to call this a new cycle, even with a 41-week cycle count. Indicators are telling me that we're very due return, we're pegged in the bottom. But again, look at, you know, look at some of the indicators back here. We were pegged on the bottom for week after week after week. This one was a good example of looking at cycle timing and thinking, well, you know, we must reverse any minute. And we're looking for a week 26, 28 low. And it went for another two months lower. We're already in week 41. But again, the outlier concept, once you're already at an outlier situation, don't put too much weight or stock behind the cycle count. All right, let's move over to stocks and the equity market. So we have first shots being fired. That was the title of this week's report. And I'm saying that because I feel comfortable that we have a cycle low here on day 42. We did exceed the 10-day moving average, not by a whole lot. It's possible that we have this extended kind of cycle here with a double bottom. I can't rule that out, but I'll get into crude oil in a second. Crude oil showed us a lot of weakness that I think is telling us that the entire risk market is pulling lower now. But that being said, I think we still break this trend line that I have in here from kind of the top of the cycle. I think it's too premature to be looking for a massive decline in the cycle. And it's also maybe too premature to think that we have a day three high only in place for the cycle. So I want to think that we're going to at least come back up and exceed the 20-day moving average, maybe exceed this high. But I think now we may not be looking at new highs altogether the way that crude responded recently. We're going to see. A lot would depend also on what the Fed has to say in the coming weeks. They may change tune quite a bit looking at the market and the risks that we have with the trade war and also the way the equity markets have traded recently. Bond prices are up substantially. Yields are down. So there's obviously some clear headwinds in the market and there's some reason for the Fed to maybe start talking a little more bullishly again. And that, as we know in the past, could push the markets higher and push us to new highs. At the moment though, I'd say red flag. But you've got to respect the ability of the equity markets to continue higher in the face of kind of bad news. But let me say, I'm going to put it out there. I think we could be looking at a top for the third cycle early. And then we could be looking at a decline. Not saying anything substantial or anything like what we saw in November and December. But, you know, garden variety investor cycle low that moves lower and, you know, forms its low kind of in late July or August in the summer months. And then goes higher again and maybe even goes on to make new highs altogether. So it's not a call on the bull market or the cyclical bull market or whether there's a recession coming or not. That's kind of a game. It's not working too well for anybody trying to predict something like that. I think let's focus on price right here. And I think price is telling us that this cycle, this investor cycle is in danger, but it has not failed just yet. As you can see here, it held up pretty well. Okay, but on the weekly chart, we see a little more evidence here that we could have topped. We have now two weekly candles below the 10-week moving average. And as I've said before, it is often a sign that the cycle has topped. We do have a decent amount of separation to cover as well. So it does have to rally a decent amount to make new highs again. But, you know, we see it right here. We do see in prior cycles, it has dipped and closed below the 10-week moving average during the daily cycle lows. So it still has a chance to recover, but it's going to do it fairly quickly, I would think. Otherwise, it definitely will morph into a top. And then we'll be looking at something that is not very common, but this would be a real sort of long-term double top, even though it made new highs for a couple of days. Then maybe you can get a little more bearish and think we have a longer-term double top. But again, don't want to go there. Want to see how this plays out. You expect a bounce back from here, maybe back to the 10-week moving average, and then maybe it starts its decline lower. Again, as I said, into July, maybe into August forms an ICL, maybe, you know, half, retracing half of the gains for the cycle, maybe even, you know, 61.8%. You just don't know. But I'm not sure, again, whether or not we want to be calling for any other significant major tops. Not in this investor cycle. I think this investor cycle is too advanced now to worry about major, major declines, even though the equity market can collapse within just three or four short weeks. I think we get something like that into the summer months. You know, maybe this was a sell in May event and then come back, you know, at the end of summer when everybody gets back from the Hamptons and so forth. And then we rally into kind of the fall months, which traditionally are more stronger months for the market. A lot of speculation here. We could just go to new highs again. Like I said, I think we want to favor the bullish side more than anything else. But we are definitely in the timing band also for a top. And we are in the timing for a latter part of the cycle. Okay. Crude oil, I think, is telling me that risk markets are going to come under some pressure. So I almost certain that we have a failed cycle in play. We have a day 50 something. I got to count it out. Cycle low here. That corresponds with the S&P cycle low. We did have some sideways chop. We had this move higher, which looked very promising. That's why I doubled up on my long position. We broke the 10 day moving average. We broke the 20 day moving average. We closed above both of those. And then we reversed and reversed sharply. So we're looking at maybe a half cycle low coming up and then maybe a move up. But to me, it looks like now we're going to be forming kind of something like this. And that would become the resistance all the way down into the summer where crude with equity market forms and eventually investor cycle low. I think we're in a third daily cycle. I think we have a day 10 top right here. I think we have a failed cycle right here. And I think we do maybe try and recover some price. But then it looks like we may be looking at lower prices now that we've topped. This rarely gets reversed and rarely do we see a failed cycle early in a third daily cycle. We sometimes see in the first and second because you just have some extreme volatility, but it's still early in the cycle when you've got buying support. And then it goes on to make new highs. But in the third daily cycle to see it fail fairly early and also with little room for other interpretation, I think we're seeing a top right here with this market. So I want to be looking for shorts now, but I want to wait for it to get back up and at least touch the 20-day moving average for me to feel a little more comfortable with any type of short. We're below the Bollinger Bands now and definitely is oversold in the short term. And here it is in the weekly. In the weekly, it was up at the top of the Bollinger Bands a couple of times, dropped below the 10-week moving average. Going to close below the 10-week moving average. So to me, it's telling me that this run here is now over. Again, maybe consolidate, maybe chop around, but eventually moving towards the next ICL during the summer as opposed to maybe, as opposed to threatening to make new highs. Yeah, and just as I thought yesterday that we may have on the dollar, probably have a top with that way, that wick was showing and it looks pretty clear now that we have another top. We expect a left translated cycle here because we are so deep in the investor cycle. This is one, two, three, four, five, six cycles in now, all short ones. Looks like we're going to come lower, but still a nice pattern, mostly besides one here, a pattern of higher highs, sorry, higher lows and mostly higher highs so that the cycle's still moving up in general. And interestingly, gold didn't really respond. It responded yesterday to this move. It hasn't responded so much today. So that's a little concerning to me as well. So I think this comes back down and here we go. Comes back down. Maybe forms a failed cycle because we are deep in the cycle. Forms another daily cycle and then comes up again and then maybe forms an ICO here or maybe further down. Very hard to tell. Overall, I'm bullish on this chart, but in the short term, starting to get a little bearish, maybe kind of a double top here. We are late in the weekly cycle and I'm going to cover the weekly cycle right here. Here it is here. Last weekly cycle low. It's been a chop, but upward grind really all the way through. Last four or five candles have tested. Well, it's not really a whole lot of resistance to be honest with you because it's only three candles in the cluster here. It's maybe more of a sort of a wedge or starting to form like this. So a couple of different interpretations, but overall, I still think that this is moving higher and in the short term though, we want to come down and form that ICL right there, then come up. Yeah, then maybe it starts to break down and maybe it breaks down from the bottom of that. I don't want to speculate too much, but I think there's still a lot of strength in this chart. In the short term though, we just drew this low here and let's see how gold responds as well with that upcoming ICL on the dollar. So that's been the weekly report for the Financial Tap. I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope you have a great long weekend here in the US for those stationed here. And I'll have a midweek update next week. Again, happy trading and see you soon.
