Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas coming from New York, Monday morning. It is the 22nd of April. Hope you had a great weekend and I want to wish you all a good trading week coming up. So let's get stuck into it really quickly. This is going to be a Bitcoin cycles report as we do every Monday, mostly focusing on Bitcoin, going to cover the daily chart and the weekly chart and let's have a look at what of interest we see. So firstly on the daily chart, very little change of course. We have very, very narrow candles here on the daily. We have the last kind of five not moving much intraday, very little volatility. I think volume is relatively light and we're starting to see the Bollinger Bands now coming from the big expansion that we saw out of this surprise cycle. Low starting to come together again now as we've had about two weeks of sideways trending action. So I think what this is telling us here is that we will probably constrict a little more. I think I mentioned that last week, how we could probably just just move sideways for a little more to the point where they get really tight and then ready to go up higher for another move. Overall, I don't see a whole lot to be bearish about at the moment. I know a lot of people are bearish or are maybe concerned that we're going to see another downtrend and another decline. At the moment, I just don't see any evidence of that. Of course, anything had happened. I always I always preface anything I say with anything can happen. But for the time being, again, it's the same analysis, right? Longer term since December, let's call that intermediate term. Since December, we have at least one higher high coming from the cycle highs. So this one will be a higher high no matter what guaranteed. And we have at least two cycle lows that are higher than the previous ones. And there's a good chance that the next one will also be higher as well. So that is the definition of an uptrend. We are still in the relatively early parts of this daily cycle or the 60-day cycle. We're only around day 22 or 23. Of course, where we market is a little bit difficult to determine at the moment. But that's irrelevant. It really is because this is an upside surprise. This is a cycle low in this area without really forming a price low. Those are the most bullish types. I've also talked about that in the past. So now we have this move higher. I really do feel that we want to form a right translated cycle, meaning the top occurs past the midpoint when measured from one green arrow to the next green arrow. Those green arrows are the cycle lows. A right translated cycle is an uptrend. I want to see one. I think we're going to see one. The previous two cycles were actually surprisingly left translated even though the lows stayed above the prior low. And that is really the definition of accumulation where we've got all this selling pressure and the cycle is declining. But there's way too much accumulation here that's keeping the market afloat, keeping it well supported and well bid. And then eventually when all that selling pressure is gone from that cycle and then price can naturally increase because you had the same level of accumulation that comes in. Then of course, as the cycle begins to top, you then have more selling come in and then the same thing happens. The second time it happened though, the selling pressure was relieved earlier. There was more accumulation and then boom, it's led to another explosion higher. So you see that pattern reoccurring. That's really what cycles are about. Cycles measure and give you that underlying either weakness or strength in the market. Right now, it's telling us, in my opinion, that we have a lot of strength here. It's building up and I think we're going to get this big move higher. It may not exceed the $6,000 level. I don't know. This is my primary outlook. This is the way I'm positioning and looking at this market. Then we get to this area. That's going to get everybody very bullish. And I think then we can finally drop down and then look for the next 60-day cycle low towards the end of May, basically another month away from now, maybe even a little more than that as well. We have had a couple of very short cycles or fairly short cycles recently, 53 days, and then something between 47 and 54 days. Both of those are on the short side, which means in theory, to start to equal these out or even these out, we may even get a cycle low in sort of mid-June as well to compensate or overcompensate. So around the day 65 to day 70 area as well. That's something to look out for. Still a few, obviously over a month away from that, but that's something we will be paying attention to once we get down back into this area. Let's take a look at the weekly chart of Bitcoin. And so far, it's looking like a nice big bottom for the bear market itself. Four-year cycle low in December is looking more and more as if it's a sure thing. I would say it is close to it, definitely in a 90% probability range as far as I'm concerned. We are now looking to test the bottom of this support area during the bear market. I think what we're doing here is we're still consolidating for the next move. For me on the weekly, this looks very nice. The 10-week moving average, which we, if you look at this since the top back in January, and once we traded below the 10-week moving average, price only came back to the 10-week moving average a few times. And those were at the tops of the 60-day cycles. And they would spend no more than kind of a week, some cases just intra-week, some cases maybe two weeks, like here for example and here. But in each time you spend, price spends most of the time below the 10-week moving average. And the other thing you'll notice is the 10-week moving average in a bear market is mostly declining. I think right now we're looking at the bottom of the 10-week moving average. Now we're seeing the 10-week moving average start to increase. We also note the separation between the 10-week moving average. Got a little too far ahead of itself right here. And I think what we're doing here, instead of coming back in terms of price to touch the 10-week moving average, we now have it sort of trending sideways as the 10-week moving average begins to sort of catch up. I think we're going to start and we're going to get into the zone. I think we're going to get to around about 62 maybe, 6300 even. We could surprise even more. But then I think we get back down and back below the 10-week moving average. So similar to the decline where the 10-week moving average price comes up and pierces it on the high in a bull market. And let's go back here to the 2017 period. See here, in a bull market, 10-week moving average is moving higher. Price stays above it for most of the cycle. And then during the decline, comes down and pierces the 10-week moving average. In every case, just about same happens in reverse and the decline. The only caveat here for this is that we may be trending sideways for a longer period of time, kind of like what we saw right here. But still, point being is that I think we're going to see price spend more time above the 10-week moving average than below it, which means the 10-week moving average should continue to sort of trend higher. Maybe not at this sort of steepness, but it will continue to move higher as Bitcoin begins to sort of come out of this bear market bottom, start to get price above the $6,000 range and start to put in right-translated 60-day cycles, which is the definition of an uptrend. So let's turn on even like the Bollinger Bands, for example. Yeah, so this took us above the upper Bollinger Bands. We haven't been above the upper Bollinger Bands since 2017 or 18 on the weekly level. This took us above, this candle here was entirely above the Bollinger Bands, so we do need to sort of consolidate somewhat. And I think that's what we're doing here. We're consolidating into the Bollinger Bands again, with a 10-week moving average, catch up some more, and then some of the excessive bullish sentiment and overbought conditions will start to relax, and then that can allow price to go higher again. Going back to the daily chart, I don't think we're going to escape at some point at least a good shakeout, and that shakeout, like in every market, can go for longer and deeper than most people expect or want to see. So just be aware of that, and that can happen at any time at some point in the next sort of few weeks. I don't see it coming now. If it does, that's a little more bearish than I would have liked because this cycle has not really been enough sort of right translated for me to be comfortable. So if it starts breaking down from here and starts spinning below the 10 and 20 day moving average, I think that would be a danger point because that would mark this as the high, and that's only sort of a day 10 to day 15 high, similar to what we had over here. And that could mean that we're going to see a much more pronounced decline, maybe even all the way back down to this sort of 3200 level, and even lower down to the December low. That would mean that we're going to see or we would see that double bottom or that test of the lows earlier than I thought and more so in May, as opposed to something like maybe in July or the summer months where I think we may get a really steep test of the bear market lows before then allowing for a big bull market to develop. Okay, let's just take a couple look a couple of other sort of random coins Ethereum because I am long Ethereum versus the dollar hasn't hasn't gone highest. It's tried a couple of times. It's really holding the line. Look at the 10 and 20 day moving average zooming in a little more really together. Now, it's kind of like getting to the point where you get the band, the bands are getting tight. It's going to get to the point where you think it's going to either go higher sharply or lower sharply, of course, meaning more volatility. Still long this still like the chart still think it can go higher. But of course, any any move back down to kind of this 158 area is a reason to get out that wouldn't then that would mean the pattern is probably broken and starting to come back down to test the bottom of the triangle down here. So just staying long for now. I still like the chart just patient be very patient. I'm not trying to I'm not over leveraged. I can handle a move down to 158. It gets me stopped out. So be it if that's the case. But right now, because I think the upside potential is all the way up to sort of 235. I can just be patient and wait here with a smaller position because any move up here, I'm going to be able to hold and I'm going to be able to profit from if it gets up there and the the risk reward is much higher up here in this area. So just be patient with this guys. There's nothing to nothing to do but wait and watch. Take a look at a couple of the other charts I've posted in the past. EOS still looks pretty good to me. It's come all the way back down. Hasn't sort of I thought if it gets below the $5 level, it'd be an issue. It got to 501. Still looks valid to me. The bands are getting very tight like they did here and here. I think the uptrend continues. I like EOS versus the dollar still. I think Litecoin dollar is in a very similar position. Coming down now, threatening to break down, getting really at that danger zone area. But I still think this is a healthy consolidation after all these step ups that we've seen over the last four or five months. I think this can still go higher and continue the trend from this point. ADA has pulled back probably a little more than I would have liked. Again, I'm out from a trading position. I've banked on my profit. Still have a long position I'm going to hold unless this initial neckline breaks. Too much separation here from the neckline last month to coming back to watch this break down and then start losing on the position. So I won't do that. But still think that it could reverse higher. But again, I don't like the amount of pullback we've seen here. It could mean that we've seen a top for the intermediate level here. Especially obviously if the altcoin space is not going to continue rallying, then this is showing us that we're going to get back down into this bottom area. XRP still looks very bearish. It's actually done exactly what I've said it would for the last two months. Continuous decline, consistent. Then it started back in the beginning of the month to really begin to accelerate those declines. We had a pretty big drop below the Bollinger Bands and that explained that big move back higher. Continued much lower. At this point, I mean, what can I tell you guys? People ask me all the time whether this is something to buy or to trade. There's nothing to buy right here. This is not a good looking trend. It's been down since December where you see most of the altcoins found their bottom. A lot of them did. XRP kind of found its top. So it's almost like it's inversely trading to the overall crypto market. So yeah, I mean, if the altcoins find a bit of a top here and decline for the next month, maybe XRP rallies back up a little bit. And also it's a type of coin that can do something like this very sharply, but you can't position yourself for something like this. I mean, you look at these charts and people may claim they made money on that, but the only money they made is if they were already in the position and rode that all the way down. I've pretty much been telling you to avoid this and that would have saved you quite a considerable amount if you did avoid it. It doesn't mean though that you want to be positioned here in case it does rally up sharply because the trend and the chart is telling us that it wants to continue lower and lower and lower. And there's really no bottom in something like this because there's so many coins that are issued. It has shown the ability to get all the way down to this 4000 level here and actually in fact back in December to 1000 level. So there is an unlimited almost amount of downside potential here. So my only analysis here is if you like Ripple from a long term, I don't personally, but if you do, I'm not going to judge, then maybe from a value standpoint getting some here, some position here or sort of cost averaging in now that it's at this lower level is maybe not a bad idea. Don't overdo it. But from a trading standpoint, there's really nothing here except for maybe staying short or being short because the trend is lower and you always want to stick with the trend where it is clear like it is here. Let's just finish off with bat real quick. Putting the load out around about 40% lower from this price. Hit an amazing, I think my last alert sort of said take some profit if you could around this area. It might have even been a little below this. Did hit looks like 93 hundred overnight or yesterday. Pretty amazing. This looks like it's well look, these type of charts as we know in the crypto space can continue for seemingly, you know, beyond anybody's expectation. So there's no reason why this would not or could not continue. I like this one from a longer term perspective. Have a position in it. Took some profit as well. I think this is a good spot if you have not taken any profit in your long to take some, I think on a pullback say down to maybe the 10 or 20 day moving average is a good point, a good point to maybe get some more position as it pulls back. But this is the type of thing that it's now kind of running if you look at it from February, since it's real low here. The fact that it was above the September lows, this is the most positive thing and now it's broken out and this could run for for much higher as well. So this one I like still take some profit if you're long from well before as well. Okay guys, that's your weekly Bitcoin cycles update. I hope you enjoyed it. Leave me any questions that you have. I'll come out with a midweek update on Wednesday. All the best to you.
