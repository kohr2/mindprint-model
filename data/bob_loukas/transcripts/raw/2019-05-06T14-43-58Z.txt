Good morning and happy trading week to all Bitcoin Live subscribers. This is Bob Lucas. It is May the 6th and it is Monday morning in New York. Hope you're all doing really well. This is your weekly full Bitcoin cycles report. Mostly going to focus on Bitcoin from a daily and a weekly standpoint. Get a little more in depth than we normally do. So let's take a look at this now. So Bitcoin, let's start with the daily cycle here. A lot to be excited about. A lot of positive developments continue here. The most important aspect of this market from a cycle standpoint is that the current high is now on day 41. If Bitcoin does not make a new high, the arrow will go here and we will have a day 41 high from the last cycle low, which will end up almost certainly being right translated. So of course, for any new members out there or recent members, please take a look in the education section under cycles and Bob Lucas so you get a better understanding and appreciation for some of the terminology and what we mean here. But in a quick little rundown from one cycle low, one green arrow to the next green arrow, that's one full cycle. We measure that in trading days, the midpoint of that cycle typically comes around day 30, which is half an expected cycle. Cycles have been running a little short as well. But let's just say day 30 is the midpoint of an expected cycle. Then anytime the top occurs to the right of that midpoint, it's a right translated cycle. Anytime it occurs to the left of that, the top, it's a left translated cycle. Left trend led cycles because they peak early, they have many more days to cover to the next low and typically it means that it's a downtrend. In an uptrend, the high appears past the midpoint, which means there are more trading days of a rising market versus trading days in a declining market. Therefore, you would expect the overall arc or the overall price to increase over the cycle and for the cycle low to form above the previous cycle low. Pure math, it doesn't always work perfectly. In fact, the last two cycles here, if we put the midpoint day 53, a midpoint would be day 26. Let's just put it around here. Okay, the top actually occurred on day nine, but you notice the high was above the previous high. This is a bullish accumulation that we see. More days declining, but still stayed above. So in the nine days in the beginning of the cycle, we had higher price. Then the 42 days of decline, similar in the next cycle, we had 47 days, which is what's that around about 24 ish or so days. Let's put it around here as the midpoint rally for 18 days and then it actually stayed flat and then rallied higher. So all positive developments past the midpoint looking at day 40 high. And we may even still have a further high, maybe day 47, 48, day 50. We don't know. The more right translated though it becomes, the less of a decline we should expect. Again, all in theory. Okay, we can get severe declines in just a matter of five days as well. But in general, again, the idea being fewer days declining means fewer or less of a price decline. But overall, the presence of right translated cycles, and this is the first right translated cycle, in fact, I believe for about a year. So this is a good development in itself. Okay. But the other problem that we have is I do, and I've said this pretty much since December, that I expect us or Bitcoin to fill in this price gap. So in above this 4200 and below kind of the 6000 level, fill that gap in for a while, not just one small cycle, which is why I think any upside move from here remains very much limited, and would pop back in below this area. I want to see or do expect at least to see zooming out here, kind of this gap filled in for some months, a couple of cycles. So here's one, maybe two, maybe three into September, then it can release and make room and head up above the $6,000 area. I'll cover that in a little more detail in the weekly summary coming up shortly. Zooming back in to the daily, let's see if we can find anything of significance. So basically, what we have here is a low, a low, looking for another low here. So we still have this step up nature structure to this chart, which makes sense because we are making also higher highs. Here's a high on April 9th, another high then on April 23rd, another high on May 4th, around about 10 day blocks. So in theory, we just made new high here, made as high as 5800. We are probably still consolidating those gains, so it was good. One, two, three, four, five daily candles higher, probably need two to three, maybe even four candles back, still have a good amount of gap between price and the 10 day and 20 day moving average. So it's filling in and coming back kind of to earth, so to speak. But the uptrend has not shown us that it's broken down, we can start to begin to get a little concerned that it will break down because it is day 43. But again, the market needs to prove and show us that it's in a downturn before we make the assumption that it is. Just taking a guess that it is because we are extended or in the latter part of the cycle is not enough in trading. It doesn't give you the edge to do that. You'll catch a couple of highs here and there or a couple of tops. But in general, you need to see the market prove itself to the downside before we think there's a top in place. There's plenty of time left before we can even consider a top. Zoom in even further here, let's see some key points. Now, I think, so here's the last low. So really, we can't assume a low is in until this cluster here around the 5000 level is lost. I think what we need, what will happen though is that as we come back down, maybe somewhere in the 55, 50, maybe even the low that we have in this today's candle could form the low. But I think maybe tomorrow's candle will form a low, maybe 5500 or so, give or take. Then that can become the new established low point where as it rallies back up, it either makes a double top with May 4th candle or goes on to new highs. But that low then could be placed as kind of your stop or at least the point where we think if it gets broken, if it gets taken out on the downside, that the top will be in place. So almost kind of similar to what I drew kind of a week ago here, hasn't really changed. Let's just say tomorrow we get a low at 54.92 for argument's sake. Then we rally up, up into May 10th at around about, to say again, argument's sake, 6100. Then we know that this low that we have here can become kind of the next break point. So as it comes up, forms the cycle high and comes back down, then we know as it breaks below this 54, 55 hundred area, that the cycle was definitely topped. And by that point, the 10 day moving average would be probably $100 or so below that. 20 day moving average will probably be above that point as well. And we know that a loss of the 10 and the 20 day moving average late in the cycle is almost always a sure sign or an indication that the cycle has topped and that it's now in a declining phase. And then from a decline standpoint, when it eventually does come, and again, it could be already in right here on day 41. But when it does come and it's going to come soon enough, I think it will retrace it all the way back, we'll probably lose this support here. It's not really so much support, but it does intersect a couple of pretty significant lows set back earlier in the cycle. And then it's just a matter of how much of a drop do we get. Okay, we know that Bitcoin can lose hundreds and hundreds of dollars in an hour or two. So as much of a decline, as much as kind of over $1,000 at that point is not out of the question and would be just fine. In fact, from a bull market standpoint or from the end of the bear market standpoint, it's all just fine. Coming back and retracing to the tops of the prior two cycle highs here in February and December is perfectly fine. And as I said, we probably are looking at this chopping motion in between this 4200 and 6000 area for a while. And let's look at the weekly chart now and you kind of see that a little more clearer fashion because you are zooming out. So here's the weekly covering the entire bear market down, down, down, down, down, break capitulation, four year cycle low, two, three, now three cycles going higher. But I think now we're going to go for a little bit of a tough period in my opinion, over the coming few months, I think we're gonna, we almost at that top. Again, there's room here, see how wide this sort of support or resistance band is now, because it's, you've got a number of different price points back in 2018 to work from. So I think there's room here for it to continue up to the 60, 6,000, 61, even 6200 area before topping for this cycle. And then let's just get in our drawing tool here. So let's just say this week it goes up. And then there is room to come all the way back down 4400. Then I think this is where, I mean, I'm happy to see it go up perfectly happy. Nobody would be happier than I would to see that. But I don't think, I think we need time to do that. I think we double top more than anything close to it, then we come back down. And then we do possibly a pretty big shakeout. And this double top scares people, it scares technicians. It's they start to think, well, that's the end of this move. And the continuation of the 2018 bear market continues. This kind of paints the picture and gets people worried. And then when it breaks down and breaks below this coming June or late May cycle low, that scares the hell out of everybody. And then coming close down to kind of these December and February lows, again, does the same thing. Scares the hell out of everybody. People capitulate even more, sell even more. And then that's when you get the final, it's not a bear market shakeout, but the final shakeout allowing now the next bull market to begin to get its legs and to continue higher. So then that's when I think we start to come back up. We test this one more time. We come back down into a September, October cycle low, then we come back up, then we test. And then likely at that point, November, December, we actually break. Okay. That's just, again, this isn't absolute. These aren't lines that you can look back in six months and say, wow, look how close it was. That's not the goal. The goal is to pretty much outline my 60 day cycles intertwined with a longer term cycle to give you an idea that we need to go through a number of these 60 day cycles in the accumulation phase of this market before I think we can say, okay, now it's time to go up and start the next bull market. Anything below this 6200 to 6400 area is still technically not confirmation of a new bull market. And I think that's why we need a couple more of these cycles here. Below this area, more accumulation people to kind of give up a little more, and then we can move higher as well. Okay, so that's the analysis on the weekly chart for Bitcoin. All right, so let's finish off a little bit of fun here on the monthly chart. Monthly chart of Bitcoin shows something pretty interesting. So we've got four green candles working at the moment, three obviously locked in, that's the past. And this one here is the May candle. Now, according to my 60 day cycle analysis, this candle probably or should turn red before it's done. It's early in the month, only six days in. So in theory, this would go back to a red candle making this a three month streak. Even so, you've never seen or you never do see three consecutive green candles in a bear market. It just doesn't happen, or at least it hasn't happened in Bitcoin. Only a couple of examples, of course, to go on. But even when you consider other markets, other asset classes, typically very unusual, see three rising months in a bear market. Not saying it's out of the question, but I think this is just telling us here that we are now in the accumulation phase or the early phase of the four year cycle or the bull of the next bull market. And that's positive overall. So even if we see a red candle now, next still three, three green candles is, I think, bullish and probably sort of similar. If you go back to this period right here, the last bear market kind of had three candles here, three candles here, and only two. But even here, you only see two as the most. You'll see green throughout the decline in the bear market. And you don't see three until it's kind of coming out, already coming out after a six month sideways move. So another good reason why I think it's probably unrealistic to expect another green candle right now. And but at the same time, just positive that we have good, you know, good 60% move off the bottom with three green candles. Okay, everybody. So that is your analysis on Bitcoin from the daily, the weekly, and also the monthly, as I've been saying now for about five or six months, be patient, the market's going to turn. Bitcoin is a new asset class and crypto, of course, that is going to get its bid and it's going to turn again in a new cycle. And now you've come so far that we're just about just about out of that tunnel. And I think it's all positive ahead. I think we have one big shakeout to come. And as I've said, I've been saying this for a long time, be prepared for that mentally. It may come here in May in the next sort of three or four weeks. I think it most likely comes in July or August, of course, again, once once that's in, once that final kind of nail or shake out its end, it's going to be a amazing ride from that point going forward. Be around for it, preserve your capital, always manage your stops, of course, as always. On Wednesday, I'll come out with a top 10 report covering the market caps of the top 10 coins. There, you'll also be able to request a coin analysis on any coin that's out there for Friday's lightning report. As always, leave any comments that you have, I'm happy to answer them. And I check back often and frequently. Thanks very much for being here and all the best.
