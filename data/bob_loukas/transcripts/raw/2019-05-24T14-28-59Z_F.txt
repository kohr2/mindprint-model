Good morning Bitcoin Live members Bob Lucas Friday morning May 24th getting ready for a long weekend here in the US I hope you're doing well got a lot to cover here and let's get stuck into it this is the lightning report for the week I had only three requests for reviews so we'll get those done as well but I have a number I want to cover also want to cover a couple open positions and I also want to cover Bitcoin because Bitcoin right now is looking really really good now we're on day 60 of a cycle but we have price only sitting you know three four hundred dollars below the recent highs considering we had a you know a three thousand dollar move in the cycle if not more to be sitting just three four hundred dollars below the highs right now is I just can't I can't tell you how bullish this is to me this looks like we are still consolidating the gains but we're going to form a we are forming sort of a more of a pennant here than anything else maybe and that we're looking for this to in theory as they always generally do break in the direction of the trend and the trend is obviously going higher I still have this marked here because that's how I'd like to see it form I really like to see a sell-off in a cycle but I don't know if we're going to get anything like that I mean I wouldn't be surprised if today or tomorrow it's definitely over the weekend we just get you know get something like this and then off again it goes that's the bias I have because if you look at the trend for 2019 that's all we see we see something pretty much from the bottom here only three months ago barely a little over three months ago gone from 3,300 to 8,400 you've got to respect that and you've got to think that this type of consolidation we're seeing is a pause in an uptrend so from a leverage position I want to get long again if we start breaking to the high side I think the number is around about maybe 83 or 84 certainly anything above 84 I want to jump on board on a leverage trade for a move to maybe 9,600 or something like that maybe even 10,000 is a nice round big number that this market is looking at for up here so again I'm long in general from my trading accounts all my leverage accounts are long bitcoin because they're denominated in bitcoin I'm talking about getting some more leverage only for you that is sitting in something like USDT again this is a difficult time if you're only if you're only tracking your performance against the US dollar doesn't really matter because that's all you care about but if you're trying to go between the two then I'm not sure again with this type of pause if you want to be sitting in just dollars only look for a breakout certainly anything above 8,400 right now is probably almost almost certainly a new cycle and that makes this a consolidation low and then a move higher again and we've had a couple of those already if you look at if you look at what we did here just hasn't hasn't given the market hasn't given any chance to form a sell-off type low like we saw during the bear market almost all the lows in the bear market all of them all right had you know sell-offs and that's typically how you know what you'd see in a cycle low but right here the first one was a decline but it wasn't a sell-off the second one wasn't it was an upward trending market and then an explosion higher so we've had two of those already it looks like we're going to have a third at the moment I guess that's three minutes of me talking to tell you that this market is really hot it looks like it's consolidating and it looks like it may want to go higher again again biases to the upside be careful on the downside because we do have a cycle load due I'm looking to get long from a leverage standpoint above 8,400 definitely not shorting this market I don't see why you would want to short something like this looks like the early phase or start of a new uptrend and I don't want to be short all right let's get into some of the open positions here is probably my well it is my largest non-bitcoin position so it's ethereum still looking decent although starting to get a little concerned it hasn't really done much yet still above the 20-day moving average which is rising I kind of have an alert set at this point at the 0.03 area I might be getting out it's around break even I believe it is I don't want to mess around too much just like I did with ripple yesterday if it's not performing not showing me what I want I want to get out I don't want to be sitting around in a position just for the sake of being in a position if it doesn't look good right away you want to be out so this now has kind of flagged for a number of days I really want to see it start now I want to see it starting to move I want to start to see something like this and give me the confidence that way that I can start to move up my stop to you know like that for example and then so on so keeping an eye on this still looks okay it still looks like it's you know it has a big big three candles to consolidate as well so I'm giving it time and it's only it has not come back to below the one big candle so the fact that it's still above this level right here is still okay for as far as I'm concerned so just keeping an eye on this for now go BTC is still um still looking pretty good it's above the 10 and 20 day moving average we're now about to get the cross it um you know is near the top of the Bollinger Bands looks like a good turn still a valid trade as far as I'm concerned um so looking soon to maybe raise the stops if we're possible but the go position is still long for me okay the next few are just going to be a quick look at some of the I think I posted three or four alerts or one alert with three or four charts in it just with some ideas this one is is one of them vibe uh the reason being it broke a pretty decent downtrend right here and the 10 day moving average is starting to turn up looks like we have some big wicks to the upside so this looks decent right I mean again you don't want to be allocating too much to these types of trades uh your stop for now is right below here if you are long something like this that's a still considerable amount in the altcoin world from 620 down to 480 so again size these accordingly we're only losing a small amount uh if you're wrong and if you get stopped out and you're trying to make these trying to raise the stop quickly to a break-even point as well and the reason why you're using a very small amount is one these can all fail fairly quickly or fairly easily but two you know you want to be trying to capture a really big move up to say in this case you know 10 1000 or 1100 and that's almost a double so whenever you're looking at risk rewards at sort of the you know the six to one eight to one ten to one which aren't very common but in the altcoin world they're more common you want a smaller position because you're looking at bigger bigger you know bigger wins potentially so just keep that in mind but vibes it looks pretty good to me I mentioned raven coin not as a buy uh only that it has a potential look at the 10 day moving average is about to touch the 20 but price is below those two points so it can't do much unless it starts to break higher but if it breaks high at this point and gets above the 10 day moving average and breaks this trend line I think it could be a buy but again you know you want to be sized fairly small this thing is a type of thing that can move very rapidly like we've seen here and I think we've also seen that in the past so again you're trying to capture really big moves you only need a small position your stop if it does break and if you do take it is kind of this little cluster that we have right here you also may want to wait for more confirmation by looking at this candle up here and the reason why you may want it to go above that is that's a definitive change in trend because you would have a high here and a higher high and then you'd have a higher low so you kind of get you know one higher low one higher high that is you know really really the um you know the definition of a trend change so you get something like this then you break okay that's how I like to trade a lot of these especially again because there's so much room in a lot of these trades that you don't need to necessarily capture the first 20 percent because you're looking for that 50 to 70 percent move up here and if this type of confirmation gets us a better a better opportunity or a better chance that it won't get stopped out then then of course that's what you want to be doing but again breaking out from here it's a very tight stop so it also depends on the type of structure that you have in the trade right here because you have a couple low candles if it did start moving higher there's a fairly small gap between entry and stop so you probably could take a gamble on on the breakout and then move above a 10-day moving average loom was another one had a similar structure again um you know small small position guys these aren't anything special these aren't uh all coins that have done you know done anything like in loom's case you know it's kind of at the lows it is at the lows so it's not like this is a relative strength type of play this is just a a simple chart pattern player that could you know has a good risk reward but you want to keep them nice and tight and these are the type of things that when you're wrong you're wrong right you just get out and if you if you if you miss a move you you miss the move you don't chase it so um this has kind of broken the trend line not definitively but it is above the 10 and 20 day moving average that would be a stop relatively tight um and then you kind of see where this goes and then if it does move higher move your stop really quickly to that break-even point and learn to trade with really tight stops and and and break-evens so you you're taking very few losses and then eventually when the market turns and you get two or three big winners all of a sudden it's like wow this is you know this is this is a very good um return on my portfolio because you're limiting those losses and you're taking advantage of the runs when they come so crypto now or sorry crypto.com uh old mco this one still needs to break this one's not a trap this is not a valid thing yet uh you definitely want to see a break of the 20 day moving average 10 days still well below this would be a stop which is really wide again small position this one's still on the watch list enj is actually very similar to um the raven coin chart we're looking for a break again we have the makings of a break we have a 10 day starting to turn up maybe come up above the 20 price is now above 10 and 20 day moving average so this one is shaping up but it's not ready yet this corner can easily fall back down um you have kind of um this area down the bottom here the tops which is still a good 30 or 40 50 below it could drop there but uh so you want to wait and be patient see if this can can break this trend line and then also you may want to wait for a confirmation above this top here this candle that's better confirmation here that sort of guarantees at least a change in trend whether that trend sticks is a different thing but at least you've got a clear um you know uptrend in place and of course again same type of thing when something like this can move so rapidly then you need a small position only to take advantage and that way you're limiting and risking limiting your risk on the downside neo is another one of those that looks like it wants to turn 10 days above the 20 but price is below i think you want to get a move above kind of this 1500 1600 area for confirmation and then your stop becomes you know this candle right here or by that point you can move it up to whatever the low is before it turns up still again need confirmation that it's turned had a good start kind of creating a flag here looks like it may want to go up but again wait for confirmation before committing to anything like this got a member request for link link has obviously doubled in price it's gone phenomenally well i actually sold this was one of six positions for my long-term portfolio i sold three quarters of it yesterday um when i see price like this i take advantage yes it could go much higher but um when it doubles in price i will take profit i did the same with eng eng for when it when it spiked it took half that so this is something i took profit on but from a trade standpoint yeah it can keep going you know i i never touch things like this i mean for me now there's no buy-in this is just chasing um people are worried that it's going to do this you know what and it actually may do that this type of charts can keep going and going and going my problem is if i get in where's my stop am i uh looking for here for a 20 30 move where my stop has to be 20 30 below just to cover the volatility that we see for me there's no trade right here so if you're long is the only time there's a trade and yeah i would stick with it i would use kind of like a couple of two day trailing or three day trailing stop rule of some types to look at the candles you know go down three candles and kind of put a line across and that could be a stop and as each candle goes higher you can keep moving it up something like that could be a strategy you need to give it some room if you're long because yes this continue this could continue going higher for three four five candles in the same kind of velocity but at the same time you can just go boom right back down and take out every single stop so just be aware of that okay somebody requested storm this is my first time looking at this okay first note is um at at lows and significant lows from you know wow look at that from you know almost a thousand satoshi down to 43 so no offense to whoever posted that but this is basically kind of like a dog right but from a trade standpoint you may like it again this has a similar structure to all the other charts where you have a low have another low so that's kind of your stopping point you have the 10 day moving above the 20 day moving average you have a short term trend line break so there's a positive you know about this so this could be a long trade you got a nice tight stop you're going to stop around about 38 satoshi it's at 42 right now and it could move higher you could also wait for a move above this 50 level it is giving up another 20 of the move but anything above that is definitely a trend change again same theme same type of style of trades same type of chart structure than all of these which means that you want to be uh not so allocated well not not you know you don't be picking all of these because if they fail they're all going to fail probably together another member request was dash dash looks pretty good i mean it had a big sell-off of course and at new lows so i don't like it because of that it's at you know main new lows in may that doesn't show me there's a lot of relative strength this was one of the darlings back in kind of 16 and 17. um i'm not i'm not hot on this at all from a long-term standpoint i got to be perfectly honest with you but it has a nice move here it definitely broke the the downtrend well above the well at the 10-day moving average above the 20-day moving average uh it's come back a bit so yeah you can look at going long here so you're buying the dip buying off the 20-day moving average not my type of trade not something i want to take but yeah you could take this and then look at that 20-day moving average as just stop right there so let's just draw that in for you something like that so from a trade possibly otherwise i i don't see too much here that i like but again has a good move off the bottom which is good so you your play here would be just buying a dip a retracement after a nice move with the hope that it's going to continue higher and finally agi another member request the first time i'm seeing this just judging by the wicks and the way this candles uh structure this is probably lightly traded um kind of like a double bottom here so that's that's potentially a decent sign again providing analysis here on the fly um plenty of room even just to get to recent highs which is a double so yeah this you know this is very speculative again not my type of thing looks like it may have found the bottom 10 days time to move up above the 20 day moving average obviously the recent candles are your stop but that's you know that's still almost 200 satoshi below that's 20 or 30 decline so you know a very small position on something like this and then your goal is up to a double uh not my first choice not my second or third choice but there's potentially something there for you um again not liking it for for myself but you've got uh you've got your risk defined right here from you know from where it is today at 700 down to the 520 if you make a very small position you could perhaps come back up all right finally total market cap still looking good forming another flag apparent this time i think this looks good um only problem with this chart is that it is us dollar denominated and if bitcoin goes up in price then you may get uh you may get all the old coins go up in market cap to the us dollar but not necessarily perform any better against bitcoin and actually may underperform bitcoin but bitcoin goes up that's the uh the one kind of fear that you have trading the old coins that's the lightning coin update um long weekend i have guests visiting i'm not going to be that active but i am looking to buy bitcoin on a break of 8400 just be aware of that thank you very much and have a great weekend
