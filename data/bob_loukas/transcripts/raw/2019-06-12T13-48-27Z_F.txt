Hey hello Bitcoin Live members it's Bob Lucas Wednesday morning in New York the 12th of June hope you're doing really well this is a top 10 crypto market cap report I'm going to cover the top 10 market by market cap in this space I don't think the list has changed from last week and the week before so we'll cover the same coins again and I'll also spend a little more time on the three open positions I have in the space now of course everything revolves and begins with Bitcoin I just posted this chart here on Twitter actually in fact but I'm going to go over it in a little more detail so what I'm outlining here is I wouldn't call it my primary viewpoint necessarily but it's more the view that I would love to see so I'd love to see eventually a failed daily cycle so by failed I mean the idea that we have the cycle low here on day 54 big volume in this area good decline in the timing band I don't see anything else that sticks out as a cycle low at this point I was thinking that we could have one coming out of this decline here so around about day 70 day 73 cycle low but it's held on really well since and hasn't given me the type of decline that has me feeling comfortable it just looked like we're forming a flag or a pendant right here I think based on the idea that we could be topping and that we have a day 12 high in place that this will break lower but we also have quite a bit of support I think in this 7200 area that could that could maintain and hold this decline for now and what that would mean is that we would have possibly right here around 16th of June so in around about four or five days time we would have the half cycle low so the half or midpoint of the next 60 day cycle that would mean that we have most likely a left translated cycle in play so day 12 remaining the high for the entire 60 day cycle also meaning that there is that that high would not be exceeded unless or until the next cycle perhaps and maybe even the cycle after that but that remaining a day 12 high that makes it left translated so from this low to the next cycle low the midpoint occurring to the left of the midpoint so that's what gives it that left translated cycle that causes a cycle failure meaning we drop below the last cycle low but I don't think overall that's necessarily a bad thing I think we just need more time to consolidate this massive run that we've had and if you're like me and you're obviously looking at a big bull market to come you want to you actually want to see something like this unfold over the next month or so this gives it the time to consolidate those gains to consolidate some profit taking to kind of get out get get the sort of trapped longs or people who want to get out at this level give them a chance to get out but at the same time let some new blood come in and accumulate in the zone and then the final decline here would sort of serve more as a shakeout before reversing and moving higher again so ideally this is the most preferred outlook but and I think I covered this in Monday's cycle report there is a couple of alternative scenarios here that are in play and that's why I don't have a leverage long or short position right at this moment because there is a number of ways this can go obviously with this type of move this 180% move this could be just a very brief consolidation before the market then resolves itself much higher from this point so we could easily still get this at a continuation and we want to be ready for something like that and get ready to pounce on a move like that in that case we still have the same type of markings but this is not the high the cycle high would come further on and this is just I wouldn't call it weak action in the early part of the cycle but it's just you know well I guess it is weak action in the early part of the cycle but more of a consolidation of this move before going higher in the second half of the cycle the reason why I don't favor that outlook so much is because after a move like this you typically see a continuation of that strength until you see an end in the move so that's why I think we have an end in this move and we need the consolidation period over a full cycle I think if this you know if this big move here was continuing higher you wouldn't see this clear cut 10 day moving average cross with the 20 day moving average you wouldn't see this sort of breakdown occur this to me looks more of a breakdown as it does then it does a continuation of the the rally higher and that's that's why I'm sort of believing that with this outlook here is a more favored one over something like a move higher and and you know I rally up now getting a move above I would say kind of this level here forget the wick the wick kind of sets the high for the cycle but if you zoom I'm going to zoom in here just to give you a little more view you kind of look at the tops of these candles I think that's more relevant if we can get and let's let's kind of look at that there if we can get a move above 87 8800 then I'm going to start to think well something else is going on here maybe we are looking at a continuation of this massive rally and this pause or this this block here of candles around about 20 or so candles is the end of the consolidation the market's going higher but until that level is exceeded I don't really see a reason to be overly bullish in the short term if we do exceed that area and go higher then we're going up to 11 12 000 in a hurry and there would be an opportunity to get long at that point but then again just to reiterate a point I make quite often is that I do sit in my leverage accounts in BTC also in my trading accounts on Binance everything's denominated in BTC and I do that because again I'm going to zoom out I believe in this bull market narrative that's begun I believe we'll be at 12 13 14 000 possibly by the end of the year early into next year and I just don't want to be trying to time that aspect of the market as well as finding leverage opportunities or other altcoins to trade at the same time it's just too much to handle so I want to stay denominated in bitcoin if it drops to 6400 or even lower in the next month or two as per this outlook it doesn't worry me at all because I've come obviously from the 30 the 3000 and 4000 area and again I believe I'm going up to 10 and 12 000 in bitcoin so I don't want to miss out on that opportunity and it's easy to just sit in BTC denominated when I'm not actively trading and let that tide and that wave take take us higher as well you don't want to be fighting that trend and trying to come in and out of USDT or any other currency when this market is is trending like this because then that's actively trading at the same time just trying to work out when is the best time to hold BTC or when the best time to hold your local currency is is in effect trading in itself let alone trying to find a leveraged BTC trade or any other trade so that's the outlook on on BTC here again it's mixed right and often when we're looking at any form of technical analysis the outlook can be mixed and that we don't have to have a definitive answer where the market is going we don't always know where the market is going in the short term that's the beauty of trading that's the beauty of markets if you believe that you need to know at any given time where the market is heading or what the market is doing then I think you're setting yourself up for a really big fail it's just not the case right we don't have an edge all the time we have edge we have an edge at certain points in the time in the market and it's those periods of time when we do have an edge or we're reading the market well that we want to take advantage and the rest of the time we want to simply be observing and being on the sidelines and being ready to take advantage okay so let's get into the top 10 coins now that we've covered bitcoin starting with ethereum all right not much of an update here we've spent two weeks on ethereum um i guess flagging this big move that we saw over three trading days coming off the new lows that we saw um again tightening bollinger bands low volume however um i'm positioned long my stop is very tight something i want to respect i think if we break down from here that we can be heading back down to test the lows um but again i'm still kind of hopeful or mindful or thinking that we do out of this consolidation break higher just as litecoin has done bitcoin has had a good run so it also stands to reason that some of the top 10 coins will have the opportunity to make a run the bitcoin dominance index has rallied or moved higher for a considerable amount of time so my thinking here is that these other coins will have their day but thinking and an actual price actually are two different things have your stop respect the stop again i'm positioned long for this one my target is up to exceed the peak that we saw on may 16th maybe even get up towards this sort of february peak or even this early january peak as a move that's around about 20 or 30 percent maybe more of a rally from here and that's my goal for ethereum against the dollar it's moving pretty well it's flagging again so everything against the dollar looks pretty good and that's because bitcoin against the dollar looks good and this is why i don't cover the the dollar pair with a lot of these old coins because i do that with bitcoin um if bitcoin's dominance is going up and then these are all going to look pretty good against the dollar as long as they hold their value against btc but again if you're just trading purely against usdt then this is a beautiful looking chart um you know you've got this breakout here you've got another consolidation period stands to reason again that we're going to be looking for another move higher and then the next leg could be you know up towards sort of 330 320 3 to 3 to 3 40 even um if you look at kind of the move that we saw up here so this could be just a break in that period going higher it comes to ripple i think ripples pretty has a pretty similar price action and behavior to what we're seeing in ethereum and i have mentioned this in the past that they have similar structures and that if one fails or one succeeds succeeds and the other one will as well i'm long this bands are getting really tight i think again i think a move is coming and just like ethereum if we lose the lows or recent lows then in this case you can see that we have a high here and we have another high here that's lower so then that would reverse the pattern and can and have a continuation lower we would have a lower high and then if this line breaks a lower low which stands then then you expect then that this low here would get taken out and the mark would move considerably lower from there so respect the stops know when you when the chart's wrong and at this point getting below the may 26th low means that any bullish narrative is wrong very likely be wrong and you want to be out and then you could even short a break of this line here as well no real edge on bitcoin cash we do have a very tight bollinger bands as well probably looking at an expansion um soon which means volatility goes up price and because price is going to start to move um not looking not liking the way that uh we're currently sitting below the 10 and 20 day moving average to me this looks like it might move lower first so for me i don't i don't like anything here from a long perspective and there is more of a short perspective looking at this chart at the moment i think we have a high here then we have a low then we have another high here didn't do much and i think it could be rolling over but again i don't have much conviction either way on this one so that's why i would avoid either side of this market yeah eos is a little bit of a mixed bag because it has performed so well since december had a big run-up similar to litecoin came back down and has had a big move already but then kind of disappointed with the way it's reacted since it's come back an awfully long way and maybe too much as far as i'm concerned too much of a pullback here after it found a low in may and clearly started heading back up so this is a bit of a worry for me i'm not sure you'd want to get in back long at this point uh looking at this little area here if we get lower and then reverse that could be an opportunity to get back long but for me there's a high volume sort of reversal and decline clearly back below 10 20 day moving averages and the 10s crossed cleanly below so for me right now i don't like too much about eos all right litecoin is continuing now uh from you know continuing this move higher uh i posted a blog post yesterday about this i'm long this of course it's been a really good trade so far i want to keep it that way i want to start to move up trailing stops picking logical places uh using peter brandt's kind of method three day trailing stop kind of want to look at some some candles three days back four days back draw a line in the sand and say okay if it gets below that point get out and take take what profit you have so looking at the june 8th low at the moment that would be a good a good point probably like a 0.0145 area as a stop getting below that point right now is is a sizable drop unfortunately but this is the problem when you have a sizable move like this is where do you place your stops where one you don't get caught in a you know a mini shakeout on the way up so you need to give it room and giving a room means obviously giving up a lot of space a lot of a lot of room if it does actually come back if it pulls back sharply you don't want it to pull you out of position unless it's actually topped and that's the challenge that we face and that's also the reason why i've put in a couple of points here where i'll start to take profit automatically because i have to give it so much room on the stop side to let this unfold um i need to then it makes sense then to take profit at a predetermined level as opposed to a stop level around the way up because the stops are so wide i hope i'm making sense there but again let me try and explain that because the stops are so wide to give this room um it's going to be very hard to keep trading this up all the way up as it goes up and get to a point where i'm i'm making profit say on a 0.02 stop out right at that point price and let me go up price will need to be up around about the 0.023024 for me to have a reasonable stop at the 0.02 area to give it that room so it's very unlikely that i'll be able to get out with profit at the 0.02 level on a stop so the best way to do it for me is to do it on a profit target stop so when it hits that level i just sell automatically so that's what i'm doing right here heading for the 0.02 and then the 0.025 and then 0.0 sorry yeah 0.225 0.0 225 and then the 0.025 area and then ultimately on some crazy spike up maybe even the 0.03 area and the reason why is i've explained that in that article is that light um light coin is going through a halving event in august previous halving events really caught a lot of attention and the price spiked significantly and then also light coin currently is being talked about and considerably in social media and in the forums so there's a quite a bit of fomo going on right here and you can see this in the volume and you can see this in the price action but again i don't want to overstay my welcome i want to have a trailing stop that's in place and take profit no matter what because you just never know um some of these moves sometimes end early we could double top off this point here and come back so you still want to keep an eye on that it's just a balancing act between giving it room giving it a chance to really spike and make a make a significant difference in your portfolio but at the same time not giving back all the profit you've already generated so that's kind of how i like to approach these i like to let winners like this run and let them turn into massive winners massive winners make a difference in the end not just not a bunch of singles or small trades or small wins so that's how i'm approaching light coin yeah binance is actually looking strong again i didn't think it would get up to this point um i i i mean i don't know this strength has been so amazing at this past i thought we would be forming this sort of widening pattern here coming back down it looks ready to keep going higher i think i still like some other charts a little more uh bnb versus the dollar still looks great and this looks ready to move higher so versus the dollar this i think is going long here with the tightening bands i think this is going to move higher again um so that means against bitcoin it should also do fairly well unless bitcoin also moves higher at the same time allowing this bnb versus dollar to go higher while maintaining its level against btc but i think overall you really can't go wrong being long binance coin it still has a lot of strength a lot of momentum behind it and you all you want to be long the momentum coins and assets all the time and a chart like this typically just keeps going going and going obviously at some point they end but predicting an end to a move like this is a mugs game doesn't really work you want to be long these pullbacks and right here this looks pretty good to me so um trading against bnb dollar i would stay long i'm long from a um from a long-term portfolio standpoint from a trading standpoint i'm not at this point because i do trade btc again i think if we can exceed this high here i probably would get interested again in maybe taking along on this one but let's just see if we can kind of get above this area for now and then for me i would then look to maybe go long the xlm doesn't look too bad stella i mean i don't like the coin you know that um from a fundamental standpoint but it does look like we have kind of a flag after this move um but i would want to see a little more a little more of a sort of break up uh before getting even remotely excited we do at least have a couple of good wicks there to set some stops on so you could go along here and but i think you want to see a break higher first at least a break above the 20-day moving average and then you've got a reasonable or at least a well-defined stop period right here to get you out of the trade so that's not that's not too bad but overall not my cup of tea not something i want to get involved in but it does look decent we have a move higher back down into may like many of the coins break higher new 2019 highs at least at this point um so that's positive and then somewhat of a consolidation so overall not too bad and if you like stella and you've been trading a lot this actually doesn't look too bad at all ada actually looks really good this is something i was going to do an alert on i'm thinking of going long this one now that we've broken up um broken exceeded the the june third highs and now coming up to the may highs uh looks like good consolidation the bollinger bands are starting to expand looks like we can take a long position now on this and then use the june 9th candle low as a stopping point uh that would be around about 10 decline so um you you couldn't really allocate more than 10 of your trading portfolio if you're looking at a one percent stop or risk on on your on your capital so this here is an opportunity i think i'm going to make an alert on this one as well i think i might go along at this point but again uh nothing to go crazy rushing into you're looking for the potential risking a 10 here and looking for a move up to 16 17 1800 as the opportunity so plenty of reward in this one as well yeah tron is similar to ada in fact we had this big move up and then it's just come all the way back down into that bottom channel that we saw late 2018 into the bear market lows but it is still kind of struggling to get out now i want to see some upside action probably want to see more of a reversal confirmed reversal with the move back above this candles here from early june that's giving up a lot of room but this is a more of a longer longer trending place and more of a position play so i'd be happy to give up some of this space here wait for confirmation because the opportunity then is a move all the way back up to 850 900 that's a doubling at that point from even even this sort of candle from june 2nd that's a doubling at that point so no no point in rushing as far as i'm concerned when it comes to tron okay that's the wrap up on the top 10 market cap i hope you enjoyed that believe me any questions or comments that you have below and as always i'll be answering frequently all the best to you happy trading speak to you soon
