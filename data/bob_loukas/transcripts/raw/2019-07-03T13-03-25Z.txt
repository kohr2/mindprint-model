Hello Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas. Wednesday morning in New York, July the 3rd. Hope you're doing really well. This is your top 10 market cap report. Going to cover Bitcoin as we always do and then go into the other nine projects and coins and make up the top 10 market capitalization. Before we do that, some housekeeping. Tomorrow is July the 4th here in the US, which is Independence Day. So it's a holiday and because it falls on a Thursday, I will be taking Friday off, taking the kids up for some camping. So I will be pretty much mostly off the grid from tomorrow through until Monday morning. So I'll have and I'll cover this in a second. I'll have my stops in place. I'll have some profit targets in place and some stops on my open position. But otherwise, I tend to try not to be checking into the markets all that much. So you won't hear from me over the weekend. Next, let's go into the open alert that I posted yesterday. This one was not a high conviction trade, although essentially, and looking at the four hour chart right here, looking at an end to the downtrend from the July 26, 13,800 high, had a big move down, came back up and then had a second lower low. This here measured pretty much 30% from the decline. So my thinking here was that if we are and let me zoom out, if we are kind of consolidating in this area before going higher towards 20,000, 30% would be more than enough for consolidation. This would be the low. That's around about let me let me go to a daily here. Yeah, so 123456 days in from a decline. So then my thinking here is simple would capture, capture an entry near the low provides some somewhat of a stop. But then you know, the goal here maybe is we chop around form a sideways sort of cycle low like we have in the past and then do something like this. That's kind of what I'm thinking. I want to be positioned in case that does happen. Obviously not this low here. Something more like this and then test of the highs and then go again. So I think it just afforded an opportunity to get in right here. I did like also on the four hour chart, how it came back up here. And once it exceeded this area here, which was kind of the 10 bar average, looked like a mini trend had been broken. So wanted to get long right now. It looks like we are flagging on the four hour chart. Not very clean, but looks like it's consolidating a couple of big candles here. So I think now it's safe to to move up the stops quite a bit. Let's go at the candle right here at the four hour, at least to that point 10,400. That provides a nice stop where the risk is very little, especially if you took my warning, which was on an $800 stop, you have to be positioned size wise to only lose 1% of capital. So moving up this stop here, puts you at about a point zero or sorry, 0.4% risk of capital at that point. And if we do get further upside, so this is something for the weekend. If we get further upside, then you'd want to move your stop up to break even right here below this candle. You can almost do that now, to be honest with you. And then they can just sleep comfortably knowing that you're in position. And if it goes higher, you're positioned well. That makes a little tight though. You could get a stop down here and then go up again as well. That's why I want to stay away from it. Although it is above the 10 and 20 bar moving average. So if we have a new uptrend in play, you would think this would probably stick. Again, so now we've had four or five great trades over the last month or so. It's been a very good run. No losing trades that I can remember, at least in the short term. Don't push the envelope. Just keep trading. Keep the stops nice and tight. If you get the opportunity to move those stops up and risk little or get to break even. Even better. The name of the game here is not so much to win big. The big winners come like they have recently. The name of the game is to not lose during the bad times. So lose as little as possible. If we can keep minimizing our downside risk on each of the losing trades, lose well less than what we initially set out to, or initially what we risked on the trade, then you'll be well positioned for when the good trades come to be able to ride those higher. I think that's what we want to see here. So profit target wise, I don't think I want to take everything off the table if it goes higher, but kind of this cluster up here to me looks like where it could reach and then if it was to go lower again, it would kind of falter up in this area. So close to, let's just say, for a whole round number close to this $12,000 area, get up to that point, it would be above the Bollinger Bands, but it may falter there and then turn lower. So I would kind of put in a first target of around about 11.9. So take, you know, take some profit, not a huge amount because it shouldn't be a very big position. Take some profit at 11.9, move your stop up to sort of this 10.8 level, which is also at the profit level, and then just let it ride. And then see what the market wants to give us. If it wants to go up to 12.5, 12.8, 13,000, then great, then we're in a big profit position. So that's how I'm going to look at to play it. So I'll put in a profit position, take around a third of the profit off at around 11.9, stops to be at around the 10.4. What's that level here below this candle? Yeah, 10.4 would be good as well. 10.4. And then by Friday morning, if we have moved higher, I'll probably move this up to break even as well before I go off on my trip. That's how I'm approaching Bitcoin. So this, this also was a little bit of a Bitcoin narrative on what I'm thinking is going on. I will go out to the daily though, and give you a bigger picture of what I think is going on. So we have, again, this beautiful trend from February up one cycle, two cycles, three cycles, in the ending process, we may end up marking this as the cycle low, which would be a short cycle. Or two things are going to happen, I think I don't think that will be that will be the cycle low. I think what will happen is either we get this narrative I just described, where we trend sideways. And we like we have sort of here, and here, and here, we have these sort of consolidation cycle lows. So the market is kind of forming, although this one's a little lower, kind of chopping along in this, and these consolidations, let me clean it up a little bit here. And then we're kind of breaking out and going higher. So if we're looking at a continuation of this parabolic, like I don't want to use the word parabolic, because it's not, I think it doesn't have the speculative nature that our parabola would normally have. I think this is more of a recognition, a recognition type of move, and a supply move more than anything else. But if this still has legs, and this trend is still in play, then I think we're going to console that like this cycle low would be some point in here, won't be the low of the cycle, at least not the recent low. And then we zoom up, and then we go higher, I've covered this on Monday, I think we go up, and then we go towards all time highs, coming out of this move. Okay, and then that could be the top of this beautiful trend that began in February. That's scenario number one. I'm leaning slightly in this favor, because we have the trend in our back. And the trend is something I respect more than a prediction of a reversal in trend. Picking tops or picking bottoms against the trend, I find is a losing proposition. I've talked about that as well many times before. I don't like to predict tops. A lot of people look at moves like this and say it has to end, it has to end, it's far too much, you just can't go on anymore. Fact is, they tend to go on for a lot more than you expect. So I don't want to predict tops, unless I see the evidence. Now, we did have more of a move lower than I would have thought if we were consolidating for another move higher. I did not expect we would get kind of below 10.3 again. 10.3 was a low kind of on that second candle on the way down. Similar to how we saw this move down here, this low here never was never sort of tested again. We tested this and we also came down to a 9.6, so 9.7 level. That was pretty extreme, but at the same time, we are getting pretty extended in this move. So we expect to see wider swings, more volatility as we get higher up towards that $20,000 level. So I'm willing to say, well, that's just part of the sort of shake out and the volatility that we see. And if you look at the price, it was a shake out of, you know, it was a good 30% move lower. Here it is here, sort of almost just slightly above 30%, 31% move lower. That shook out a lot of people, especially when you see it coming after two or three nice big cycles higher after a 200% move, that type of, that type of decline is enough to scare anybody holding big profits. And I think a lot of people were shaken out right here. And that's why I think the market can recover from here, consolidate and go up higher again. Now, now that we've hit 11.3 though, and I'm going to give you the alternative scenario. Now that we've hit 11.3, if we do move lower again and begin to go down to test some of these lows that we just hit the last few days, if we go back like this, then I think we are looking at a continuation of the cycle lower. I think we're looking at a major top or at least an intermediate cycle top right here, meaning that the move from February all the way up topped right here, and it's not going to be tested again for maybe a couple of months. So this is why this is important. Now this low, this candle right here that we saw yesterday has to hold in my opinion for the move towards 20,000, the rally to continue. Otherwise, we're looking at a intermediate level top, a decline, and I think we can get down to as low as sort of 8.2 and worst case down to 7.2. And why are those important, those numbers important? Two reasons. One, I believe that a 50% decline in a bull market, which I believe we're in, is the absolute max you can kind of see. Sorry, 40% should be the max. So 40% move gets you down to this 8.2 level. I think that's important. Now, I did say max, but we have this cluster here. We have this breakdown point from November, which is around kind of the 6,400 area. That is, I think, not in play, but is kind of like the worst case scenario that I think is the absolute flaw. I don't see us getting there. I think this cycle low and this level here, the 7.2, for me, is a more logical point where sort of a crash or a decline right here can get to. And that gets us close as to 50%. 50% should be the absolute max in a bull market correction or decline, as opposed to the 85%, which is a bear market decline. 50% should be sharp and should reverse relatively quickly from that point, not to go back up to new highs, but should at least come back up quickly and maybe sort of consolidate sideways for a while. Those are the two scenarios I'm looking at. I think more logically though, if we do lose the recent highs, I think the 40% level, that's my sort of worst case target. And personally, is that 82, 8,300 area with the worst case of 72. I use the worst, worst case a couple of times there for different numbers, but you get my point. So watch, watch this level quickly. I'm going to closely, I should say. Here it is. Here, zooming in, this candle here becomes important. Recent lows here, the 97. That's got a hole that breaks down and then the trap door opens for lower prices here. So watch that. But for now, respect the trend, respect that it's trying to recover here and get back up to this sort of 12,000 area and then maybe consolidate. That's how I'm looking at Bitcoin. I think the cycle has obviously topped for the 60 day process. So that's why I think we still need to work, um, either lower or sideways in this cycle to end the cycle before we can go higher again. All right. Sorry about that. I think that Bitcoin analysis took longer than, uh, normal than I expected, but hopefully it helped and hopefully it gives you at least my thoughts on the coming kind of week or so for the two kind of scenarios that we have for Bitcoin on the Ethereum and the rest of these coins, kind of the same feeling I have here. I, I do see some improvement in the charts or some possible bottom, uh, bottom, bottoming, um, patterning, patterns that we see here. Sorry. I'm scrambling for words this morning. Um, but not enough for me to get very excited just yet looking at Ethereum, for example, just recently, we kind of tested the lows again, um, held up slightly, but we have really a pattern here that, I mean, could be forming a major base, but could also be kind of forming a huge descending triangle here that testing sort of, you know, one, two, three, and then goes lower again. Can't rule that out. So there's nothing for me to, to do on the long side of this. It really would have to, uh, so here's sort of a mini, here's a high, it has to sort of find some support, go up and make a new high. Then I can look at this and sort of say, okay, um, maybe there's a new pattern in play here. So let's just look at that right there. One here, maybe form a low. So the only time I get even remotely excited, and this is not a clean pattern anyway, but is there, I would get a little more interested right at this point here, we can make a new high. But, uh, even then I don't think I'd get overly excited. I would maybe start a position, just take a look and see where it goes. Um, so for Ethereum in general, don't like much about this, but when we look at Ethereum versus the dollar, still holding up well, still has that uptrend. And again, this is only a function of Bitcoin going up versus the dollar, which is pulling all the altcoins versus a dollar higher. Don't be deceived here and thinking that there's a lot of strength behind these altcoins because when you value them and look at these charts and that by the dollar, it's Bitcoin that's bringing these up. Um, so let's look at EOS. No correction. Let's look at XRP. So ripple here. Uh, I mean, look, I, I have been pretty much right along in, in, in mostly staying away from this. I took a couple, I took, I think a trade right in this area here, thinking it may have reversed, didn't cost much at all, uh, got out. So this is the reason why you have stops, of course, but now we're in kind of no man's land. Let's just zoom out. We lost whatever support might've been in this area. It tried to rally off that. And that's why I got a little, you know, a little positive on, on ripple here. It had been in a longterm decline, looking for one of these major spikes didn't happen rolled over. Uh, and now there's really nothing here besides whatever we see. And again, this won't provide any real support. This is just where price is traded in the past, but because price has been in this area all the way down here in the past, which is 50% lower than here. There's a chance it's heading for that area. I'm not a fan of ripple overall. Overall. I know some people passionately are, um, I don't want to get into kind of the politics of this, but I just don't like the project in general. Um, and, and that kind of, I think gets to my bias when I look at this chart, but overall, even from, from a chart perspective, there's nothing substantial. There's nothing I like about this. We had this one big move that was bull market, um, or the bull market had topped for Bitcoin and the alt coins went higher. That's influenced this move here. But in general, since that time, ripple has just done nothing and it continues to be in a downtrend. So until we see major improvement and constructive chart patterns here, there's nothing to, to do a ripple besides maybe shorter if you have that capability and you know how to do that. Yeah. Bitcoin cash also does not look that good. We have soon downtrend. It looks like it wants to go lower. Got a level here that probably provides some support. It's traded recently there since the fork. I think it's heading for that area right there, which is lower. I don't see a reason to own this or want to own this. If it reverses again and takes out this high from yesterday, that maybe there's an opportunity to look for a trade. But right now I don't like anything about this, this, this chart. And I want to avoid this. EOS looks a little bit like Ethereum. I mean, it's amazing how quickly, even this chart, which is one of the best looking charts versus BTC coming out of the December lows. This one had a lot of good relative strength, but it's coming all the way back down there. And I think this wants to test the bottom here in December and it's getting close. And maybe if Bitcoin has another move higher, that's exactly what it's doing. But for now there is not much that I like about this. Again, same type of analysis. If it gets up, gets above this level, then maybe we're looking at a bottom in play. But until that point, you want to avoid this as well. Let's switch to Litecoin. This only looks better to the eye because we had this major move higher, but I think, I think we may have a top in place. I know everyone's waiting for this halving event coming up in, I think about a month, a little over a month. But it looks like that event has already been sold. The news has been sold. This, this peak here was great. This looks like a counter move now, an attempt to get back up. And I think this is where people dumped a lot of coin into, into the market and into the, the retail trade. I got all out completely right here. This was enough for me. Once it lost that area there, as far as I was concerned, it wasn't ever coming back. And look at what we saved. I mean, that's, that's a 50% decline. There are people holding bags at Litecoin right now, waiting for the halving event. And just, I've written this down to February lows now. This is a lesson here, guys, that don't be greedy, right? If you have a trend, great. At some point, you've got to give it up. The narrative doesn't always result in price confirmation. So, you know, markets can be more efficient than you think. And events are priced well in advance. The smart money was getting in well in advance and was riding this move. That's the, that was the main opportunity. But this here, once, once it was lost, I mean, I thought, yes, it could go up to 0.2, 0.02, 0.025 even. But, you know, once that, that move was lost, I was not sticking around. As far as where I see this going now, it could have bottomed right here. But as turned, so like the other analysis, I want to see new highs. I want a new, a new pattern form. So I want to first see, you know, a low hold. Let's get rid of this previous one here. It's confusing. And then, yeah, so I want to see high, low, high. Okay. And then that gets me maybe excited. Then the 10 day, you can come back above the 20 day, do another cross. And then we can look for a trade. Again, these all coins move with, with such, you know, I guess not volatility, but they move in with such huge price swings that you don't need to be trying to catch the bottoms and tops. It just ends up costing you a fortune every time. The stops have to be pretty wide to do that, first of all, because of the way that these coins move. Wait, just give up the 20 or 30% in every move, and then get in when you see a new trend established. See how you see a downtrend, right? Once that, that, that downtrend formed, you can get in short. You know, once the uptrend formed, you can get in long and so forth, especially in the here. So just be patient with these moves. Don't try and jump in too early. For example, right here, if you jumped in kind of on this big bar, the top of it, you kind of FOMO'd in on this huge bar, then all of a sudden, you know, it's come back down. You just don't know what to do. You're probably going to, you know, puke it out right here, and then it can go higher again. So just wait for a trend to establish before trying to jump into some of these. Yeah, Binance Coin looks great against the dollar, but I think here we have this widening sort of wedge. And it's in decline. We've got a couple of lower highs here, definitely lower lows that are formed. This looks like it's in decline, 10 day moving average below 20. So at the moment, this is definitely an avoid. From what I can see right here, we could be heading down to sort of something like this, right? And then maybe you can come back up. But again, like I said before, for Litecoin, you don't want to be trying to catch a bottom here. Let the move, let the market find its, it's low, let it reestablish an uptrend and then look to get long. Right now, this looks bearish, as far as I'm concerned. XLM, and I've been right on this one for six months now. I told you how horrible the chart looked all the way back here when I started breaking down. This is something I've avoided like the plague. And, you know, I really feel sorry for people who view this as a long-term, successful project. This is not the definition of a long-term successful project when you've got, um, since, since Bitcoin made lows, you've got now another 70 or 80% decline. Um, let's look at that. Let's find kind of December, find this area here. I mean, come on, 70% down. Um, so I'm avoiding this. I don't like anything about it. Even if it was to reverse higher, this is not a chart I want to be buying. I prefer some of the other ones. Um, this should fall out of the top 10 very soon, I would think. And so again, avoid this. Do not like the project. Do not like the charts. And, uh, this is a severe, severe downtrend. ADA. I know, um, this is a favorite as well for many people, but this is at new lows, uh, and that's never, ever, ever a good thing. Uh, look promising. We, we made some really good profit on a couple of trades here, but again, right. Don't get married to a narrative. Don't get married to a project. If you like some of these very long term, I still don't know why you want to necessarily want to be holding the positions. When you're seeing charts like this, you can always get in later. Um, don't be afraid to wait for a good part of the move to come in. If these are going to do these types of moves, where we're talking about billions and billions in market caps, um, there's still going to be plenty of time to get back in. Uh, you can buy huge bags near the bottom or when it reverses eventually, but at 719 Satoshis here, where it was at, uh, you know, almost 2000, just a couple of months ago, that's a sin to be holding, uh, those 80% lower. Just not, uh, not right from a trading standpoint. Also nothing here again, near the lows. I think this goes lower again. At some point, these will find a lower. Maybe it's when Bitcoin hits, you know, a short-term peak, whether it's has right now, whether it goes up to 16, 18, 20,000, maybe that's, that's when these have their run. But until then, um, play with the winners and avoid the losers. And lastly, looking at Tron, Tron also looks pretty, pretty sick, actually. I mean, we've got a possible sort of double bottom here, depending on where you want to draw it using the wicks and so forth. Um, it needs to stabilize, but until it can reverse and then probably break this declining trend line. So get back up to this sort of 380, even 400 level. There's really no trade to be had here. Again, nothing, nothing I like about this chart at all. All right. So very, very briefly, just doing a summary here, as you can tell, last three months, the only show in town has been Bitcoin. I thought that was pretty evident. And hopefully for everybody following that has been clear in, in what we've seen in the top 10 market cap report every week, we had some great trades in January, February, even March, I believe in some of these top tens. And let's just look at some of these, but once they all kind of peaked here, sort of in March and April, early on, any open trades were kind of either taken out for a profit or stopped out for a, for a break even. And then after that, we didn't touch any of them. Very, very few, at least, um, because all the chart patterns looked, uh, look like they went decline. And that's, and that was just the, the tell here not to be, uh, trading some of these coins. Many people though, looked for what they thought were oversold coins or value because they were down a little bit and there's no such thing as value in the crypto world. I got to tell you this. I know a lot of people disagree with me, but fundamental value is a myth here. None of these coins can be priced towards, or in comparison to any fundamental analysis or valuation. It just doesn't have that metric capability. It's what the market deems, um, it wants to pay. A lot of it is driven by speculation or most of it is driven by speculation. So you just want to be on the right side of speculation. You want to be on the right side of the crowd. You want to be early with the crowd, um, but not too early where you are guessing at the moves. You want to be early enough where you see the trends develop. Like for example, as they developed near the tops recently, and you want to be out in that case or when they were early, we got into some of these trades like ADA, even right here at the initial break in 10th of March. And then another one here in, in 22nd of March, that was relatively early, but it wasn't early enough. We were picking absolute bottoms, right? We're taking the meat of a trend and we're getting out before it hurts. And that's the type of mindset that we need to continue to, to work on and emphasize. Um, so that's the analysis for the top 10. I hope you've enjoyed it. Sorry, a little bit scattered today, and I don't think I've had my coffee this morning. So I'm a little, uh, fumbling for words today, but, um, I think again, the narrative here is stay away from the top 10 until we see good, clear signs of, of Trent trend changes and, um, opportunity there. Otherwise I think it's still with Bitcoin and I think Bitcoin may not be done in terms of the move coming out of the February lows. For people in the U S have a great 4th of July and a long weekend for everybody else. Thank you very much again, have a great weekend and I'll be back on Monday. All the best to you.
