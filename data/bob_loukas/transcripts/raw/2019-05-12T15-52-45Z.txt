Hello Fintap members, it's Bob Lucas here on Sunday the 12th. I hope you're all doing really well. I'm going to provide the weekend report via video today. Got a lot going on with Mother's Day and a lot to discuss here on the gold chart and also the equity chart more in particular. So let's get started here with gold. Interesting, could be looking at a new investor cycle. We are so overdue, it's not even funny. Pretty much one of the longest investor cycles we've seen on record. Maybe in hindsight, in a few months time, we'll be able to see a couple of cycles within one. It's going to be really hard to tell. But the moment, it looks like we printed last week a 19-day daily cycle that was left translated. So we had four days to the top, hit that downward trend resistance that we had from the top of the cycle back in February. And then we came down half cycle low, bounced off support or resistance, I should say, at the 20-day moving average. Came down and kind of did a double bottom. Silver at this point last week, or the week, slightly I think it was the week before, the Friday the week before, made deeper lows. So did the miners. Gold did not. It's come back above the 20-day moving average. So this now confirms, which is right in the timing band, a 19-day left translated cycle. Question now is simply, was that the end of the investor cycle? Is this now day nine of a first daily cycle? It's really hard to tell, of course. We don't know until we see confirmation. Right now it is still within the sort of boundaries of an investor cycle decline. I think until we break through this resistance line that I've drawn here that intersects three of the previous declining cycle tops, or at least two of them declining, and the top here, which is the top of the investor cycle, until we see price burst through that, we don't have confirmation just yet that this is a new investor cycle and making this the first daily cycle. You would expect that it is because we are so deep into the investor cycle, but I've been saying this for a long time now. Whenever you have a cycle that is such an outlier, that is in kind of that one percent of cycles, then it's hard to trust the cycle and even use the extended cycle timing that we have in the weekly chart as evidence that we must expect a cycle low to occur. It's almost like we have to just ignore or discount what we're seeing and let the price develop itself, and then kind of more in hindsight, look for a reasonable explanation for what the cycle was doing at that point, which means that we still have the possibility that we're going to reverse lower from here. The equity markets look like they maybe find their own cycle low, so if these are running sort of anti-correlated or negatively correlated, then there's a good chance that this here provides a top on day eight or day nine. In fact, I think this candle here is the high, which is only day four, so that makes sense in a left-translated declining cycle sort of environment. This would be the logical place here for this to turn lower. I'm not looking necessarily to short this market at the moment, although it could be a possibility for a short with its fairly tight stop because we are kind of at day nine and up against this downtrend line. It provides kind of a logical point where you could play for the idea that we're going to have one big move down or half a cycle down to sort of 12.30, 12.40 area before finding another daily cycle low and the much awaited or the most overdue investor cycle low that we've seen in a very long time. So I'm going to flip over to the weekly and you kind of get a better idea what we're talking about here. So in the weekly, right, we on the weekly, we have enough now to form an ICL. Obviously timing wise, week 36 way overdue, but even so technically, even though it never got really oversold, it got down into the below 30 RSI level that I like to track and we've seen other cycle lows kind of just touch. If you look at this one here, this one here, this one here to a lesser extent, this one here even didn't didn't even come down that far. So we have enough of a sell-off We've got a MACD cross. We've got all the kind of makings of a ICL. The weekly Bollinger Band never touched the bottom but got close. So that's also enough. So what I'm saying here is that if we rally from this point, absolutely no surprise. We would probably want to try and get long at that point. But until we see that break out, I'm still a little skeptical and still looking for maybe that capitulation that I've been looking for kind of like we see here on this candle before trusting that move. Obviously, it'd be great if we can get that capitulation because right now, if we get one more two to three week decline down below the low, the weekly Bollinger Bands, that is absolute confirmation that we're about to form a bottom and a pretty big low. And then we can buy that really with a lot of confidence and maybe even a lot of size as well. But that's why I'm waiting to see that. But for right now, we have only a touch of the 10 week moving average. And then closing above the 10 week moving average is pretty much the final kind of confirmation that we look for when it comes to an ICL or a new investor cycle. And we don't have that just yet. At the moment, it looks like just a retest the bottom of the 10 week moving average that's still declining. So look, some more work to be done here. Ordinarily, I'd be like looking at the weekly count saying, well, it's past you. Let's favor a first cycle, first daily cycle kind of standpoint or bias. But right now, because it's just an outlier, I respect that downtrend a little more than the possibility of an uptrend and just waiting for confirmation inflation on the upside to call it a new cycle. Okay. So let's flip over to the equity markets here. All right. So I think I have a fairly clear cut view of the equity cycle right now. We had on Thursday, it was a good drop below the Bollinger Bands and on day 43 and a good intraday rally to close a nice point. And that really had me thinking, we've got a DCL in place. We've seen prior DCLs all the way up to in the uptrends kind of drop well below the 20 day moving average, touch the Bollinger Bands and then rally, like we saw kind of here. So when we had last Tuesday come down below the Bollinger Bands, I thought, well, that could be the DCL. And then when we had the Thursday decline and rally, I thought, well, this is the second, the lower low that sometimes occurs. And then the intraday rally was like, this has got to be the cycle low. Of course it was not. We had another deep along Friday with change in kind of tariff, you know, discussions and narrative, which of course, in the end, meaningless to this market, but it does serve around cycle low timing frames to, to alter the market action. Then we had a deeper low, pretty significant one in the futures market, I think in the morning hours before the actual 9.30 stock market open. Then we also, I think came down lower in the spot market and made new lows. And then we rallied sharply, fairly sharply during the day. So that was the reason why I got in from a second position after the first one was stopped out thinking that, well, day 44 is pretty late and the cycles have been pretty consistent on the equity market, even though we have 50 recently. But the fact, more importantly for me, was the fact that we had one drop below the Bollinger Bands and a second in reverse, and this was a third. And we were working on not so much an engulfing candle, but certainly the tips are engulfing. And it was a third drop below the Bollinger Bands. So this to me, I think we have a DCL in place. Obviously we're going to find out tomorrow morning, how the market opens. But if we do rally tomorrow morning, then I think we could probably even add to the position, get a little more long here because, because we had two right translated cycles that we upped and we did recently put in new all time highs. I would be very surprised if this third daily cycle, even if it wants to top relatively early after that, I'd be really surprised if we did not go on to make new all time highs. Normally a right translated cycle leads to another cycle, even if it's left translated to make a new high and then may possibly turn lower. So I want to be trying to cap, I want to try and capture some of this move, even though a third daily cycle, you're going to be a little more cautious. Stock market has been pretty consistent over the last six, seven years with a third daily cycle. And this trend here tells me that this is more of a healthy pullback than it is anything else. So I want to be buying this here with a little more confidence, a little more size and looking to see if we can get up to new all time highs. I'd probably try and get a second long position here and hold that to maybe if it comes up to kind of to the prior day 37 high, sell the first one there and then look to sell the second one deep or mid to deep portion of that cycle. So around day 23 to day 28 of this, of the next or the third daily cycle, whenever that comes. Looking at the weekly, yeah, on the weekly here, and this just looks like a big healthy pullback. It was extended obviously well, well above the 10-week moving average here. So this pullback to me doesn't look anything significant on the weekly chart. We've had a massive run. This is a good profit taking event so far. You can see here only just made it above the all-time highs. A lot of people are going to call this kind of a double top, even though it made new highs cleanly and call it kind of a continuation of a bear market. I don't see it right now. I don't see why we should see it at this point. So I do want to see another move higher over the next two to three weeks, maybe even five to six weeks, which is 30 days in a daily cycle up to maybe the top of the weekly of the investor cycle. And then we'll see what the market wants to do for the remainder of 2019. But right now, I don't see any significance with these other tops here. I think this more than anything else provides if you go back to a year ago and more so to this top here. I think this these two investors or this one big investor cycle at least provides more of a consolidation here for the potential for this to come back down soon over the summer and then rally higher again, breaking up and putting in one more really big cycle up into the 3,300, maybe 3,400 level on the S&P. That's just what this chart is possibly telling me. I don't see why we want to be overly bearish at this point in this cycle. Looking at crude oil here, it looks similar to equities in some ways, more of a controlled decline, didn't get that steep decline. But then again, we didn't get as much of a peak in this last cycle. And it's also, it looks like three or four days ahead of where the equity cycle has been commented on that last week. It looks like it formed its top earlier, could have formed its bottom earlier than equities as well. But the nature of this little consolidation over the last three days has been a little worried that we're going to see one more dip down here. And I'm worried that it's going to probably take out my stops at this point. It is what it is. As I say, we can't do much about that. But if we can get start off Monday on the right foot here and get above a 10 day moving average, I get the feeling that we'll leave behind the cycle low and we can easily come back up. Should similar type of idea with equity markets, good uptrend in this investor cycle, long right translated cycle right here. So I would look for a new high, so that above sort of $67 in the coming cycle, which is more than a 10% move. Form at least a new high. Not sure if it has to be right translated or not, but at least form a new high and then we can see if it wants to sort of top at that point. And then on the weekly chart, it's really done what I said it would do three weeks ago. It's come, it was extended a little above the 10 week moving average, three red candles lower. It's really, it's really taken the overbought levels that we had. It's now significantly pulled back in my opinion, back to the 10 week moving average, which in an uptrend should provide enough support. I think now the cycle, the daily cycle is ready to rally like I showed you, which means now that the investor cycle can continue higher. I think we get another rally. I think we get back above the prior peak. I just don't know where that top comes, but we could also make a move towards a $70 area. That wouldn't surprise me. Obviously now we're past the midpoint of the cycle and it's just a matter of what happens in the third cycle, whether it becomes left translated or right translated or not. But there's still, as far as I'm concerned, a lot more upside potential left in this chart, especially after three weeks of declines and consolidation. And then lastly, looking at the dollar, yeah, it's pretty much come down to where I thought it would. This chopping action continues. Friday, I believe, will mark the DCL for this cycle. That would put it at a, looks like a day 20 cycle low, which is perfect. All these cycles have been running in the teens, mostly very few of them make it to 20 and beyond. So this makes sense. Then we get another rally. This is why I think gold could have that final kind of two week decline left in it, even though the dollar has not been playing much of a role when it comes to influencing gold. If anything, they've been a slightly, slightly positively correlated as well. So that this shouldn't mean too much, but still, normally, when the dollar rallies, it does provide some headwind for gold. And I think this is what it could do here, especially if we make kind of a surprise move, even up to new highs, which would be very late in the investor cycle. I'll show you that chart in a second. But it's possible that, because we're still seeing a little bit of an uptrend here, look at the last two cycles, we have higher highs and probably going to have higher lows as well. We could see another move to a higher high. So a more extended or a bigger kind of rally out of the dollar over the next few weeks could certainly send gold down into kind of that long awaited capitulation investor cycle low. And then on the weekly, similar type of thing, pull back here. But like I said before, if, you know, just on the daily chart here, this was kind of a false breakout at this point, but it could now rally back up. If it goes on to make new highs, then it could be starting to break out of this triangle. And then the ICO eventually comes back and sort of tests the breakout point and continues higher. So overall on the weekly chart, I'm still bullish on this chart. I think overall it looks pretty good. I know a lot of people out there, mostly gold bugs, they keep trying to predict a dollar collapse. That's kind of the main narrative for gold is, you know, a dollar collapse. I don't see why the dollar should collapse. It's still the strongest looking economy out there. It's still the strongest military. There's a lot of, I mean, obviously debt's going through the roof, but that's going through the roof everywhere, including China and obviously Europe and obviously Japan. So nobody looks great from that standpoint. So I don't see a reason why we need to see a dollar collapse anytime soon. Obviously the sort of the three year cycle may be turning over, but you know, I just want to respect this short term to intermediate term price action. And I think this looks bullish more than it does anything else. I'm just going to show you real quick on Bitcoin here. Bitcoin has a 60 day cycle. We have, I'm not sure how much you know about this, but it's spiked to 7600 from 5000 in the last sort of 10 days. It's taken everybody by surprise. I was expecting higher prices, but I thought 64 would be the ceiling for this move. It's been an amazing run on Bitcoin. It proves that the bear market lows are now in day 49 of a 60 day cycle. So I'm looking for a possible top here on this spike. It is coming back in price now, even as I record this down to 6900. So it's down six, $700. I think we have a top in play, but because we had such a huge move here, I think this sort of 50 or 5,000 or 5,200 area, which is where it kind of broke out from. I think that gets fully retraced, but this whole area here may provide now some, the floor for the next 60 day cycle, and then it can continue building a base for the next sort of three to six months. But now definitely, I think it's top to for the time being coming back down to the next scheduled 60 day cycle low in the next couple of weeks. That's the wrap up for this weekend. I hope you enjoyed the report. I'll have a midweek update out probably on Thursday. I'm at the consensus conference here in New York, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So I don't think I'll have a chance on Wednesday night to do a midweek update, but probably on Thursday. Be good. Probably have an alert. If equity markets can rally, I'll probably take another second position tomorrow morning, and then keeping an eye on the crude position, and then keeping an eye on gold to see if there is any opportunity to maybe take a short. I don't know yet again in two minds on whether or not the gold ICL is in. So I want to be a little careful. I don't want to just take a stop out just for the hell of it. But at the same time, if the ICL is still ahead, there's a juicy capitulation still potentially right ahead of us. And I'd like to take advantage of that as well. So I've got to take a look at the charts and see if I find any nice setups that I think make some sense that minimize risk as well. Okay, so have a great rest of your day here on Sunday, and I'll speak to you soon.
