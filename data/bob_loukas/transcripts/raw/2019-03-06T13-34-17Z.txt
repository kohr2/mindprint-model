Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Wednesday morning in New York. Another update here on the Bitcoin chart. Not a whole lot to talk about, although we do have some strength in the last couple of days, especially yesterday. Just zooming in here, it looks like we may have the half cycle low at around about day 26. Reason why I'm saying that, I'm just looking at the RSI here. I'm looking at the way it popped pretty strongly yesterday, and now is trading above the 10-day moving average. This to me looks like it has formed a half cycle low. Looking at some of the indicators as well, looking like we might be swinging out from my cycle indicator from a half cycle standpoint. So that's good news. And if that's true, of course, it's good news. What it looks like it could be doing here is that we have a pretty shallow half cycle low in that case. That does set up the possibility that we could actually go on and make a right translated cycle and new highs and put the bear market and the four-year cycle low behind us. So that would look something like, kind of like this. Rally up, probably find some resistance at the half cycle high and the last cycle high over here. So bounce back down and then maybe test just one more time and then go at that point. And then we can still get maybe our move into well into the $4,000 range and then come up for top in the cycle, probably around, let's just say, March 20th, 14 days from here. That's around kind of day 45, maybe even day 50. That gives us then about 10 or so days to come back down, test, maybe come down into this sort of range here. Okay, and then form a cycle low and then keep going from that point. That's the bullish scenario. It's still on the table. There's no reason why it wouldn't be on the table at this point. We don't have a series of lower lows, even though we didn't have a higher high at the half cycle point. The half cycle point in the end is only a very short-term pivot point. What's going to matter is where it ends up from a high for the cycle itself, for the full 60-day cycle. So the way I've drawn it here, this day 18 high would become meaningless to a large extent at least. That would become the cycle high. Okay, and then what you'd have is cycle low, high, higher low, number one, higher high, number two, cycle low, higher low, number three. That's a trend change. That is a new series of higher highs. That would be a right translated cycle here. And now things start to look really positive again. Now, of course, there's a lot of ifs and buts in that. And we've only got one higher low at the moment. We don't have a higher high. That's just a line I've drawn on the chart. I'm giving you the outlook here, the potential at least, of what could happen. That is, for now, the bullish scenario and how a bullish scenario would play out. But, you know, I've said this many times. This is kind of the midpoint in a cycle when you don't have a clear trend is the chopping zone. And what I mean by that is it's very hard to get a position either long or short that's going to do well for you because you're kind of guessing at this point. We don't have, if you look at this trend here, it's just up and down. You know, it's moving sideways, but up and down, up and down. It's very hard to get any type of traction going, any type of trend. And if you look at the overall trend, it's still really down if you look going back into 2018. So there isn't anything here to hang our hats on. And that's why I call it the chopping zone. Now, I like to trade long on the cycle low around the day 60 area, because I know there's a good chance we'll get a good rally. And I like to trade at the end of a cycle short because there's a good chance we'll get a sell-off. But right now at the day 28 area, where we don't know if we're going to get a new higher high, it really is a difficult time to be putting capital to work and hoping to be successful. So even though I'm outlining this, you know, potential, sorry about that, didn't mean to draw that, this potential bullish scenario, there's also a bearish scenario still to come. And I'll draw that. And this is where I don't want to be trading at the moment. I want to be just paying attention. But you know, we could get a bounce up here. Okay. The half cycle, the second half of the cycle doesn't, doesn't create a higher high. So day 18 remains the high for the cycle, which is a left translated cycle. Okay. So the peak occurring before the midpoint. So then we come back down. Okay. And then again, same type of thing, same scenario I've been talking about. I don't know if bounces off this cycle low. Don't know if it bounces off this cycle low. I don't know if we get down into one more bear market low, one more low for the four year cycle. All those scenarios are on the table at the moment. That's why, you know, in trading, I know some of you want a firm 100% prediction. This is what's going to happen. I don't do that. I just can't do that because I, you know, everyone's wrong too often. We have to outline the possible scenarios and how it may play out and then formulate our trades around those scenarios as the trade and as, as price moves along one of these lines. Okay. So if we see that, you know, the red lines playing out, then we can act accordingly. Or if we see the blue lines, you know, playing out, we can also act accordingly and position ourselves differently. Both of these scenarios have different types of trade strategies. So we just need to formulate those as they come along and give ourselves the best, best risk reward opportunity, but also the best opportunity to get a winning trade as opposed to a losing trade. Right now where we stand today, going long or short, there really isn't a, you know, a good, a good opportunity to, to come out of this with a profitable trade of any type with those long or short. So we wait and see, wait and see how this progresses. Uh, we still have an opportunity to, to come down and make one more half cycle low lower. So we may not have a cycle low yet for the half cycle. So we may still come down and make this, but then it really is the same scenario after that. It comes up and links to this area here. Okay. And then we decide whether or not it wants to go up and make a higher high or just reverse lower and make a sort of a lower low, or at least retest these lows here. Again, patience is the key in this type of environment, this type of market. I know this is kind of repetitive in many ways, talking about the same chopping sideways action. Trust me, it's going to eventually, um, it's going to eventually lead to a new trend, a new longer term trend. And that's a trend we'll be able to ride at the moment. I just want you all to preserve your capital. Don't get stuck chopping around trying to find the right trade and instead pay a whole lot of fees and, you know, a whole lot of losing trades. Hey, just looking at some other coins now, Binance coin still looks phenomenal here. Uh, actually almost going vertical now. So it's too late. Um, you know, if you have a position longterm, that's great. You may want to even take some off the table. Maybe you don't, um, that's just good for you if you have that, but, uh, you look at the structure of this sort of nice uptrend, then right here, it kind of gets, um, kind of gets really speculative at this point. And this is the parabolic move. I think we're into the final stage of this move. It can obviously go much higher, but, uh, it's from a trade standpoint, it's way, way, way above the bulge bands. The bulge bands are extremely wide. Look at how, look, look at the, how they, how they're sort of widening out to absolute extremes. There's nothing here that I necessarily would, would want to get on. Nothing I like that would want me to get long at this particular point. It's just way too late, unfortunately. Um, but great trade if you're on it. Um, again, you can probably use some type of trading stop strategy, but I would definitely, if you're trading this, be taking profits, at least a good portion of my profits right here at this point. Uh, enough's enough. Certainly when it comes to, to this one here, uh, Ethereum, similar to Bitcoin, actually very similar. Um, we didn't come up. So we come down here, it looks like a half cycle low come pop back up. So we could either go up here, uh, stall around the 150 range and move lower. If the, the berry scenario presented in Bitcoin, it plays out or go up, retest the, the highs that we had last week and then go on to higher highs at this point. Hard to tell. Um, but yes, look at this. So it's, it's, it's doing the same thing at the moment. It's just a matter of now where Bitcoin wants to go from the next cycle standpoint. Litecoin still is by far the, um, the best performer of them all. Uh, I think this is a type of coin that if you don't have a long-term allocation to, you can probably get it here. It looks like we're definitely now in a, I mean, it's already almost, uh, tripled. In fact, it's up 150% looks like off the bottoms. Um, that's, that looks like it, it certainly has changed train. It's broken. It's, it's, it's made a inverse head and shoulders broken. It's broken the neckline. It seems like it's on its way back up and it has a lot of room to move from a U S dollar trading pair standpoint. It can easily get back up to this sort of cluster here, $85 area. I think it can easily get back into this $108 area. It has a lot of room left to go. Um, so this is something I think you want to be getting on board. It's still not, uh, not too late. I would think, um, it's definitely like that. Now from a Bitcoin pair standpoint, maybe a little ahead of itself here, this pullback here definitely was the, and I think I had talked about that at 10 day moving. This pullback was the place to get long. Um, I didn't get long at that point from a trading standpoint, but certainly I talked a lot about it and this would definitely would have been a lot place to go. I would be holding if you did get in at that point, there's no reason to be looking to get out now. I think the next sort of cluster is back here. So there's a, let's have a look at what that looks like. Yeah. I mean, it's not that far away, honestly. Um, but I think we get to this zone pretty comfortably. So 16,000 to 18,000 zone, um, fairly quickly and fairly comfortably, I would think, but you know, like anything, it's probably going to throw you off a couple of times easily, not going to make it easier to ride that, especially now that it's got a good pole going here. It may go up a little more and then come, you know, sort of sharply lower before going up, up into the zone, something like that. But it's probably going to ride this sort of trajectory on that trend line I have here. It's not really a trend line, but it's just a, a line that kind of, um, is the mean of, uh, of this rally here. So it's probably going to sort of mirror this line here. So it may not be as steep necessarily, but you get the point here that it's going to have pullbacks and those pullbacks are going to be an opportunity to get long again. I think for sure. Now, if this comes back and retest that 10 day moving average, I probably would want to try and get long myself on a trade standpoint. Um, but you know, from, from a long-term perspective, I liked what it's doing. I do have a long-term position, so that's good as well. Um, but this has been certainly the darling at the moment of, um, of this sort of alt coin rally. So can I look at, um, XRP here? I don't like what I'm seeing here. Um, it's hanging around too long. This typically is a continuation sort of pattern. I think it could accelerate to the downside. So I, I, I'm not shorting this. I think there's just too much, too many people follow this and there's too much strength and I'm just not interested in getting too involved with Ripple at the moment, but I think this is definitely a short candidate at this point. Uh, I think this could maybe make a move all the way back down to kind of this bottom support area here around about the 6,000 range is what I would think. So just be aware of that as well. Um, just taking a look at some of the old coins, I'm going to have a full altcoin lightning post on Friday for you. Um, just taking a look at this one here, vibe looks pretty good to me. It looks like it's setting up for another move higher. This is an opportunity, perhaps stop could be right below here at these candles here, but this looks like it could be moving higher. Um, yeah, and that's pretty much it for today. Uh, that should cover the Bitcoin cycle really well. I think that we're in kind of that middle cycle point where we're just looking for direction. And, uh, that really does determine in the entire landscape and where things are going to move across the board at this point. Again, as I said, lightning report on Friday, I'll go through a full coin report list. Uh, if you have any other ones you want me to take a quick look at, again, I'm not a full technical analyst. I don't trade, um, primarily off technical charting patterns. Of course I'm a cyclist. I look at Bitcoin first and that cycle, even though that said, I can take a look at a chart for you as well. Put that in the comments and we'll get to it on Friday. All the best to you and, um, speak to you then.
