Hey fintech members quick update on bitcoin here for those who are interested we have a day 52 top in place after a significant 100 move in the last or the current cycle over 52 training days that probably needs some more time to to burn some of that off but not looking for anything significant from a retracement i'm thinking more consolidation over time the cycle was on 59 day 59 so it is in the timing band now for a cycle low i think the attempt this week to get back up here just illustrates that we definitely are in a declining phase of the cycle now cycle counts in a parabolic type move are not very accurate as you probably know but the indicators definitely tell me that we're in a decline ideally i'd like to see maybe another week of weakness and price to come back down get below 7 000 maybe down to 65 64 100 on the low end i think that would be if we do that over the next week maybe even 10 days that will put us deep enough into the cycle i think from a price perspective enough of a correction and also from a time standpoint enough of consolidation to allow the cycle to at least start fresh start with the new 60 day cycle and then make a new move up and possibly continue this sort of parabolic trend or not not so much parabolic but certainly the last 10 days was looking of this move looking parabolic but at least continue this significant uptrend that began back in february with a surprise move and then again back in in april with the start of this cycle could be continuation of that we know from history that bitcoin once it gets going can exceed all expectations on the upside so i'm not i wouldn't be surprised i'm not holding my breath if after a good pullback bitcoin continues higher makes a push towards a ten thousand dollar range and maybe gets above that in the next cycle of course at some point i think we're looking at some consolidation here it is here the weekly clear that the bull market bottom so the bear market bottom is in burst through kind of what should have been some resistance i think now it's going to have to at some point whether it's from 10 000 below or even where we are for this cycle high 8 400 below i think we're going to need some chopping motion maybe for one full 60 day cycle or possibly even two 60 day cycles before maybe making another push over time to get towards all-time highs gonna need some more time than that i think we've done a great job getting up off the bottom here at 3 400 to 8 400 that's a huge move gonna take some time but again as i said surprises to the upside for bitcoin that's where we need to be focused i hope you enjoyed that update i'll see you in the weekend
