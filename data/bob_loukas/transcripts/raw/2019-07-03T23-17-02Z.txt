Hey, hello Fintap members. it's Bob Lucas here on Wednesday evening, the 3rd July 3rd, around 6pm. hope you're doing well. this is your midweek and also weekend report. markets are closed tomorrow. half day on Friday it's going to be very quiet, so I'll go ahead and issue a full report here by video tonight. I'll have all the charts within the video. only counts on the post are accurate and updated, but essentially all the analysis will be right here in this video. a lot to talk about today. firstly, with gold: very interesting action here. so we did have a good, sizable pullback last week. and then the question was: does it keep going higher or not? I pretty much expected, because we're on day 25 for the high, that we were looking at a possible or likely decline into the daily cycle low. I think I had marked something like a 1370 area as a perfect place for a DCL to occur. but we also had this massive candle occurred over one day and it was down something like close to $30 on on GC and on some heavy volume down below the 10 day moving average and closing for the day in between the 10 and 20 and really in a serious uptrend. the 10 day moving average is sometimes only tagged or briefly breached before it reverses higher. and that's the reason why I have a question mark now on this candle. it could well be- and to be honest with you, I think it's it's more than 50%. it's more than likely that this is indeed the first cycle low, and I say that because of the way we had this massive candle. it's almost an engulfing candle candle. but if you look at the size of the, the rally beyond even yesterday's or the sorry the day the days before open, it far exceeded that. so this is a very bullish candle. right here, from lows to highs, you have a $40 move. we very rarely see $40 moves that size. we had one similar, I think, $30 move right here on 20th of June. but this, to me, tells me that we're in a new cycle. this does not look like the type of action you would see in a decline of the first daily cycle, and that's the reason why I feel that this here is a cycle lower. it's also a reason why- well, actually it's not the reason why- I got in, because I got in before that candle, but I got into a long GC position, gold futures position, right in this area here, a pretty wide stop because I was still worried that we'll get maybe a move down to 1370- 1365 area. so I wanted a wide stop, obviously risking much more than normal, and fortunately we have now a nice sizable reversal. we can probably now go ahead and move the stop to just below that point. if it comes back down, we'll have to assess what happens then. but I don't want to be holding the position beyond that and if anything I kind of want to move this up as soon as possible as well into a nice sizable profitable position. but for now I'm still giving it some room here and then looking to see what we can do now. yesterday we had some in the overnight action. in the Asian market action. we had some really nice move up to 1437, not too far from the 1439 that we saw in the last high. I think it's taking a breather right now. we had a sizable candle right here. take a breather, possibly for a couple days and then we can see this move higher again and start to make new highs. if I extend this out and then gold at the weekly chart looks pretty nice to me. nice big surge. six green candles, seven green candles, actually maybe even eight green candles on this weekly cycle looks great, looks like it needs to consolidate, maybe even a little bit more. but again, maybe that's all you're going to see. you're going to see kind of two, two large wicks there that represent the topping motion of the first daily cycle. looks like it. maybe it just pops, maybe, back in during the start of the week and then goes higher again. the, the Bollinger Bands don't contain a massive move when it gets going, but overall this is bullish. but again, be prepared for some more snapbacks, fast moves back and forth. give it some wide stops here. let it play out. let it let it, you know, give it a chance to sort of move up. now, as we had this sort of move lower, we could see another move higher. so we kind of had this move down the base and now kind of you've got this level if we can draw this in, kind of at the 1650 level. kind of a lot of gap here to fill this. this happened on very fast action, so I can see this kind of getting filled right now in this investor cycle. I know it's an aggressive move, but then again, if you just look at, you know the way it crashed down. you know a number of years ago it was a very similar type move over, like you know, 15 or 20 weeks, so no reason why we couldn't get back up. there may take some time, like 10, 12 full weeks, but that this is the opportunity. I think it's ahead of us right now for gold. all right, let's flip over to some stocks. yeah, stocks are looking great again. S&P: new all-time highs, completely reversed. whatever bearish pattern we had seen here looks like this cycle count marking this May 13th low as a cycle low was incorrect. we now have an extended 55 day cycle. question really becomes: is this also an investor cycle low? I believe it is and I'll look at that on the weekly chart in a minute. if that's the case. this is a first daily cycle. we're ripping higher, new highs again. no reason why, therefore, that we're not gonna see some further upside, pull back into the half cycle low and then go again. I mean overall, look, whenever we have all-time highs in any market, you got to respect that, got to respect the strength that we're seeing right here. no sense in being bearish again or negative. I think you want to be allocated with a decent amount of exposure in your retirement 401k type accounts where you're sort of balancing between, you know, cash, bonds and inequities and the few options that you have in those options, in those types of portfolios. I think you want to be weighted with stocks now with this, because there's a massive potential that this can go higher, even though fundamentally you know, we know, the economy is not necessarily doing so great. plenty of reasons if you're biased to the bearish side, to to to be negative on the stock market. try and divorce those feelings. I've been trying to say that for quite a few years now. I think I was guilty of that in the past. but look, this market just wants to go higher, whether it's because the fed's gonna reduce rates towards the end of this year, whether or not I think Trump is gonna want to do a massive infrastructure spending bill. the Democrats would be happy to do one as well. of course they're gonna want their terms. but that's just politics. I think. with a infrastructure bill, an election coming up next year, the fed reducing rates, the market is basically saying that's more liquidity, it's more money sloshing around. let's, let's buy stocks. so I like stocks right here. I'm not sure where the buy point is, maybe a pullback, because this is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a. looking at the investor cycle highs the reason why i've marked this now as an icl is that this decline is too significant. we have the 10 and 20 week moving averages exceeded pretty significantly right there, and that tells me that this was a top. this was the icl. we had some extended cycle right here, so a slightly shorter one- it wasn't that shorter, in fact, it was 25 weeks- is not unusual. so i think we've come up with pushed above now into all time higher territory. but when you go back and consider that the market was 100 points away from 3 000 back here in january of 2018, this is one and a half years of mostly sideways action right here, lots of consolidation in this area, lots of rotation. i think the market's ready to go higher again. and i look at this prior example right here, where we had something similar and, if you recall, back in this 2016 zone, everybody was talking about the economy, how it was not doing so well. it was just, you know, some of the metrics weren't great and it was rolling over. everyone had a reason why the market was overvalued at the 2000 point level. um, and, of course, you know we had this multiple breakdowns. we had- uh, multiple, we had a couple of investor cycle failures, for example, you know, icl, and then another one right there. right, that was calls for a bear market. um, you know, even i thought this point maybe will roll over, especially over here and this over here, into a sustained bear market. didn't happen, broke out new all-time highs, came back down icl and then just didn't look back for two full cycles over a little over a year. a little over a year, a little over a year is not long. uh, that move was 770 points, 36 back up to this high in january. if we get something similar again, where we get a 36 percent type move, then we're looking at a 1060 point move from the breakout point up to 4 000, and that can occur over two cycles, two cycles being just a year. that gets us into the summer of 2020, still before the election. i think this is something that you should definitely consider and and not discount this possibility. okay, kind of the same trajectory. if you look at that, um, let's go into auto mode. there you go. okay, so it looks, looks as looks- part of the recent bull market. it has the same type of structure and character. so right now, you just have to respect this massive candle that we see right here a weekly close, but looks of it above the breakout point in all-time highs up against the upper bollinger bands. so for me this is definitely a reason to be very bullish long term. all right. switch over to crude oil here. crude oil looks pretty decent in fact. uh, not like- not as good as the equity markets, of course, but looking like we have now a third. we're not. looking like we have a third dcl right here, which is also the icl. so weekly cycle low is in nice rally. i think it found some resistance right here. using a trend line. it's going to break that, in my opinion. this move lower stopped me out, though the other day i was playing my stops pretty tight, wanted to protect my gains. so a decent little gain in the end from that. but i think this does continue higher from here up to- i don't know, maybe a 62- 63 area for the top in this cycle. come back down for the first daily cycle low and then i think it can continue going higher after that. um, take a look at this at the weekly level: real quick and zooming out. yep, so i don't really have this chart uh marked up at the moment, but uh, we do have pretty clear structure here. icls- uh, i'm sure where that one is there and let's go with the lows, okay, so, um, so, we had this big move up over, sort of like a couple years massive crash. i think now we may have found some support right here. we could be looking at going higher again. um, again, a lot of it can depend on the equity market narrative that i discussed earlier, but, uh, i think there's no reason why, now that we we found a icl right here above the previous ones, why we won't exceed the next high in this investor cycle, come up, fall short of this one, though, come back down, and then we can see whether or not there wants to be a series of higher highs and maybe exceed this, um, this major, major high here in october, or whether or not then it was still coming back down. hard to tell, but i think for the short term or for this current investor cycle, i think we want to do, do want to believe that we were going to go and see new highs for the ic, up above 66, 67, up towards maybe the 70 range, and then from there we will see again what the market wants to bring. okay, looking at the dollar: another new cycle seven days in. i think it rolls over. this provides some tailwind for gold. uh, maybe one slight move, but then one more move lower, make a new low and then i think we form the icl towards the end of july. i think it's overdue for one. i'm not sure how far down this goes. maybe it just goes down like this we could get a significant sell off. if it is the icl decline, looking at it from the weekly chart, you can see it right here we've clearly broken down, uh. the question is, was this right? here the icl doesn't look like it's enough to me. looks like we're only just starting to re-break down. um, so if that's the case, we do have enough room over maybe three more weeks to get down into that 95 range. we know once the dollar starts- as you can see from previous moves, it can make some significant progress on the way down. so i'm looking for something like that. looks like it's come back up to test kind of this: uh, bottom, bottom of the line there, bottom of the what was support, uh, now probably becomes sort of resistance, comes back down and then gets down maybe to the 94- 95 area at some point. so overall i think this is bearish for the dollar, certainly at the moment, while we're still in a decline, but i think even for the next investor cycle we could, we could be looking at. so let's just say we get the decline former low back up to maybe 97 and then we get something like this: uh, then that would make this picture like that: um, that's a possibility in my opinion. it looks like we could have a three-year cycle in top in place and then, um, you know, if the fed's gonna start um, start it's easing sort of policy or process, relatively more than, say, the rest of the world, then we could also see some something like this develop. all right, bitcoin- it's gonna be a little difficult to describe bitcoin here because it's such a fast moving market. i think we have- we definitely have a daily cycle, 60 day cycle top right here we're in the decline. the question is, is this the um cycle lower right here? i don't think it is. it looks too short for me. i think what we could be looking for is maybe a consolidation now over the next week or two, similar to like this last cycle did, similar to other periods right here during this parabolic like move. it's sort of consolidated sideways. it's moved higher, consolidated, moved higher. consolidated moved higher. it could be doing the same type of thing right here, and this is what i've been telling. people kind of do something like this form: another cycle lower via time and then go, and then the next go actually may be the go towards 20 000 um, just based on how this is moving. if it goes and consolidates again, that's exactly what it's going to be doing. uh, this last move here was something like: let's just price that out, let's do it from the breakout point was around about 53 percent move. so if we look at right here, look at a 50 percent move kind of from the breakout point, well, you can already see it gets you to 25 000 um. so even something like a uh 37 move actually, let's move it up to the previous highs. let's assume a breakout point occurs there. so even then you only need a 30 percent like move um. actually i'm looking at that with a down. okay, same 50 move is what you need to get up close to 50, to get up to the 20 000 range, which is where the last high was um. i'm going to flip to a weekly right now. here's your weekly and this is something i've also been tracking. see, look this. this to me looks like it could be forming a big cup and handle from this previous bull run, get to sort of a double top, then drop 30 to 50 percent, scare everybody out. but this move is intact. there's no reason why at the moment i need to predict that. it's not that it's ended, even though it's up, you know, over 200 percent. uh, i think something like 300 off the bottom. it's been a fabulous move, but you can see the consolidation: step up, consolidation, step up, consolidation. so the key question now is: is it doing another consolidation for the final step up to make all-time highs? that's really the question. i think if we get back below this, the bottom of this candle at 9: 4, then i think this has topped, and if it has topped, it can go all the way back down to 64 to 7 000- something to be aware of. for now, you want to be long. bitcoin: it looks like it's still making its move higher. okay, so that's the wrap up for this weekend. i hope you enjoyed the update. lots of good positions in gold at the moment, all looking very good. let's keep our fingers crossed. let the market unfold. good trades, uh, in crude recently looks looking like we want to try and get into equities next week and a pullback. if not, maybe just buy something. i want to be long. bitcoin: that's been a very good trade overall. it's been, uh, it's been a very good few months, uh, so keep it up and all the best to you. uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
