Hey, good morning Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Tuesday morning in New York. Hope you're all doing really well for the US folks. Hope you had a great long weekend. Normally do this on a Monday, but because of the holiday here in New York, or sorry, in the US, doing this weekly cycles update here on Tuesday. And some good action over the weekend to report and discuss. We had another big surge in Bitcoin from that sort of consolidation pennant area around the sort of 7,500 to 8,400, let's call it. This area here that we went sideways for around about 10 days with broke to the upside. I talked quite a bit in the last report about how bullish Bitcoin was looking, and it was looking more like a sideways consolidation for the cycle low and, you know, not so much looking lower. Of course, the expectation was that we would maybe break lower and form a lower low, maybe in this sort of 7,600 area. That was logical, but at the same time looking for potential for an upside break, similar to what we saw. I'm going to try and zoom in on a previous cycle low right here. Early cycle low, sideways chop, and then higher. And then similarly, back in February, we actually had a decline, but it wasn't sort of a big sell-off. Then we had a huge move higher. So each of these cycles have started with a move higher when really the expectation was for a good sell-off into a cycle low. And this is just classic early bull market behavior now where the cycle lows are not forming. We just have too much buying pressure, too much demand in these cycles, and it's not allowing for a more traditional type sell-off that you would normally see at the end of a 60-day cycle. So we saw one in February. We saw one here at the end of March. Same type of thing, right? We went sideways where we should have gone lower. Just too much accumulation, too much buying. And then finally when the selling relented, you know, and when the cycle ended, without the selling, the cycle was allowed to move higher. Same thing here in February. Selling pressure, selling pressure, but an equal amount of buying support and accumulation. Eventually when the selling pressure was relaxed, it escaped higher. And same thing here. And then same thing here. Even though we had, you know, a doubling in price in one cycle when a $4,000 move still wasn't enough. There's just, and this just tells you how much demand there is for Bitcoin right now to accumulate physical Bitcoin. Well, not physical, but you know what I mean, to hold and to store. I would think not so much from a trading standpoint, but I think there's just too much accumulation going on, whether it's for future ETFs or institutions coming in. There's a realization that price is going higher, and there's just far too much demand right now, far too much buying. And we saw this again here. We had a 52-day top, and then we've chopped sideways. Again, similar thing, you know, where do you place the cycle low? Looking at some of the indicators probably here on this move here. It's not a perfect science. When we have such an uptrend, let's zoom out again. When we have this type of move, you know, we just want to use cycles more from a timing, a guide standpoint and not an absolute, you know, where's the absolute high, where's the absolute low. You just want to be prepared for when the market might move again. And that's why I said last week, if we do have an upside break, I'm definitely buying that. So bought this one here, long this market here from this candle breakout around 81, 82 hundred. And then it's just a matter of giving it some room here. We could easily drop a little bit more, drop, you know, 50% of this move, maybe down to 84, 8,500 before going higher again. But two things that I see right now is that one, I think we are in the early portion of another cycle. So this one here, here's a similar type move where it just sort of went higher, trended higher. And, you know, well, what's this? This is around about earning a $300, $400 move over a 15 or 20 day period. We could get something similar again, where it just, you know, trends higher slightly. And then in the second half of the cycle goes again, right? So there's no magic pattern to any of these moves. It could just continue higher. But the second thing I do notice is that generally, again, price wants to move higher. There's this discovery to the high side. I think if we fall into the trap of saying, this is just far too overbought, this is a fake move, or this is just not unsustainable, this is unsustainable. You know, some of those may be true, but price rules in the end. And price is telling us here that the market wants to move higher. And, you know, I don't care if it's, you know, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000, 13,000. If the market, you know, who would have thought only three months ago that Bitcoin would be at $9,000 here in May? I didn't expect it, but we just have to be prepared for it. And if we can say we weren't expecting a $9,000 price, and nobody was, but if we were saying back in February when price was at $3,500, that Bitcoin would be at $9,000 within just a few months, within 12 weeks, you'd say you're crazy. So what's stopping us now from, you know, or from Bitcoin moving from this $9,000 area to the $16,000 area, for example, over the next three months? And it's not much because when you're in kind of one of these once-in-a-century type markets, we're in now once-in-a-couple-of-hundred-century markets, where there's been nothing like Bitcoin in terms of how the price has behaved and moved. There's been nothing like this really in the history of investing or trading. So we have to be totally open-minded and prepared and not use more traditional price patterns or traditional intrinsic valuations, for example, and just be a little more open-minded to the fact that this chart wants to move higher. That's what it comes down to in the end. And there's just an overall demand for Bitcoin, and it wants to move higher. And we will see shakeouts, and I think we'll see a shakeout soon enough. But I can't be so scared of a shakeout where I'm going to miss the primary move. So I'm long here. I'll stay long. I'll get out if this candle here, or even back below kind of the $8,000 level, if that happens, I'll probably be out at that point. I need to give it some room here because, again, there is volatility. There is, you know, look at some of these candles here. I need to give it some room. But I'm now positioned also more from a leverage standpoint to see Bitcoin make it up towards $10,000. So around about maybe $96,000, $97,000, I'll start to take off the table. And around $10,000, I would look to maybe exit a good part of the position. But I want to be exposed to the long side. And, of course, as usual, my entire trading account, when it's not in any position, is always in Bitcoin. So always taking advantage of a move like this higher and not at least missing out on the move. May miss some leverage trades and opportunities, but certainly won't miss the primary move from a one-to-one standpoint. Looking at the weekly here and, you know, we're starting to kind of get some real significant lift off. Had this massive accumulation zone right here. A lot of green candles moving higher. Clearly, clearly Bitcoin being accumulated here. And then this was the first sort of recognition moment when there was just not enough sellers left. Sellers were exhausted. Most of the sellers were kind of exhausted in this area here towards the end of 2018. Then we had the massive final capitulation. Four-year cycle low. And then this is where the buyers started accumulating. And we had this two months of heavy accumulation. And now this is more of a situation where there just aren't enough sellers in the market to keep price down. And there's just too many buyers here. So we're seeing this come higher, a lot of higher price discovery. I think we'll get some pullbacks soon enough. We've got, at the moment, looks like we're working on the fourth straight weekly candle above the Bollinger Bands. Obviously, the RSI 5, short-term type of measure, but it's pegged at 100. That's good. I mean, I don't consider that a warning sign necessarily. It's just that's what happens in a bull market. You get this overbought levels for extreme periods of time. But, again, it's telling us that at some point, I think once this move ends, whenever that is, wherever that price discovery may be. And, again, it might be at $13,000, $15,000, or $17,000. We just don't know. But when it ends, I think there will be a sizable correction over possibly even maybe a couple of months. It will happen. Again, hard to one time something like that. Two, if you're trying to get that long-term position, don't try and time it. Keep saying get in, get in, get in. I know it's harder to do as price gets. As price moves up by $1,000 every time, it's hard to take a long-term position with the fear that it'll drop 30% or 40% and then you'll be, you know, you'll have bought 20% or 30% above price or above an opportunity that you had. But don't forget, with each $1,000 that comes into the market, it makes it sort of another 10% pullback just to cover that cost or the increase. So if you're looking at this market and still wanting to get in, you know, it's always a difficult thing to say. But I say get as much as you can or get a position at least. Get a foothold in and keep adding to it because you don't know. We could wake up in, you know, in three or four weeks and it's at $12,000 and $13,000. And the correction only brings you back to $9,500, for example, above where it is today. So it's just difficult to time. Trading standpoint, again, we have a trend higher. We have a powerful trend higher. Let's just ride that for now and see where this market wants to take us. Nobody's really talking about it as well. And I don't think it's even, you know, it's a remote possibility that Bitcoin is actually just making a move to $20,000 right now. And kind of going to create this big sort of cup right now. It's possible. Just pointing it out there again for people who are sort of waiting and waiting. We just don't know what this market wants to do at this point. But if it does do something like this, right, and then maybe sort of, I wouldn't call it double tops, but at least gets to that point and then consolidates for maybe three to six months even. But it's possible that Bitcoin wants to do something like that as well. We just don't know. We have to be open to all scenarios. The next cycle will now be due around the end of July. So probably around about, let's say, July 29th. Don't know where that price can come. The correction could come into that cycle low. But again, the correction could come further with a end of sort of September cycle low that would be due. So maybe early October as well. So, you know, we could be looking at something like this. Again, I'm going to redraw this just so we can get. Again, these are just lines that kind of give us some ideas of what could be going on. And then here's sort of a correction. That's also a possibility. Just want you to keep an open mind here on price. So while price is going up, we have green weekly candles. Let's just ride this wave higher. And at some point here, again, we won't be surprised with a pretty significant correction. But I think also a correction when it comes gives us an opportunity, A, to maybe load up a little more on the long-term position if we need to. If we're a little under-positioned. I'm personally not, but speaking more to you, the members, or a good correction also gives us an opportunity to maybe even get in on a more leveraged long position that is more of a position trade. So something we want to hold over a month or two. And then, you know, something like a correction of 30% or 40% gives us an opportunity to get in with a little more confidence once we see a turn and a reversal from a low. But again, not to be too repetitive here, let's just ride this move higher. Starting to look a little parabolic, like the structure here. Nice move higher, consolidation higher, three, four weeks, you know, higher here. But again, let it run before, you know, before taking profit or getting out the market. And certainly do not short a market like this. Okay, I'm not going to spend much time on the majors because I see the exact same thing. So against the dollar, they all look really nice, but they look similar to Bitcoin. So when you compare most of these or all these majors against Bitcoin, you're seeing that they're actually near their lows, that they haven't done the whole lot. So for now, this is definitely a Bitcoin story. We know that because the Bitcoin dominance level continues to go higher. So all these good-looking charts against the dollar are only a function of Bitcoin going up versus the dollar. And then everything associated or paired with Bitcoin, like Ethereum to Bitcoin, it's holding its ground. So it's not losing value against Bitcoin, which is good. So there is strength there as well. But they're not also rallying. They're not outperforming Bitcoin. Bitcoin is mostly outperforming everything else. So as Bitcoin goes up against the dollar and everything holds the ground against Bitcoin, then naturally the value of these majors versus the dollar is going to go up. But don't be mistaken. This, like, for example, Ethereum here, this is not an Ethereum versus the dollar type of move. It's the fact that Bitcoin is going higher. So looking at, let's look at Ethereum versus BTC. Good sort of double bottom by the looks of it here. And now this is a weekly chart looking to possibly go higher at this point. But again, I think while Bitcoin is making runs in towards the $10,000 area, maybe even above, I don't see outperformance by any of the other majors versus Bitcoin until Bitcoin finds kind of that top, maybe settles down a little bit. And then we can have somewhat of an altcoin run or a major run with everything else. And we see that Bitcoin dominance level come down again. Until then, it's really a Bitcoin story. So just an update here on positions. I'm going to go ahead and close GoChain. Not performing the way I like, slightly below entry point. Again, my point here is I don't like to just hold positions for the sake of them. The pattern was a breakout reversal. It has now come back down and moved below the 10-day moving average. So for me, even if it does go higher, I don't really care at this point. I want to get my money back into Bitcoin on this and just look for the next trade. Very agnostic when it comes to trades. Not emotional. I'm okay with taking a small loss versus a big loss. For me, it's not about win-loss ratios. It's more about how much money I have left in my account. So I have no desire to let it trickle back over to one cent profit, for example, or one satoshi profit. That's irrelevant as far as I'm concerned. My Ethereum to Bitcoin position is still open and leaving this one open. I'm monitoring this closely. I have an alert set right here on this big candle. The fact that it hasn't retraced the one big candle yet is, I wouldn't call it bullish, but it's at least keeping me in the game at the moment. But again, 10 days starting to turn back lower. I want to see price begin to go higher and the 20-day moving average acted some support. But yeah, I'm not too convinced either. I did mention just in the same report that I think while Bitcoin continues to surge higher, looking for that $10,000 range, that it's going to be difficult for everything else to kind of rally against it. So just keeping an eye on this one very closely. I think any drop below the 20-day moving average at this point. And in fact, I'm going to move the alert just slightly lower, knowing that if it drops below, it's going to be a drop below a 20-day moving average. And that's probably going to get me out of this position. Still a profitable position at the moment or right at the profitability sort of level. So I can leave this go for now. And then I showed a couple of opportunities that were brewing on the watch list. None of them have already panned out. I haven't taken any of them yet. Ravencoin, I think was one of them. It didn't break out. It's actually moving lower. And then I think the other one was ENJ. Let's check up on that. That was also one in process. Yeah, this is similar as well. Has not broken out. Looking maybe for a double bottom here. Again, I want to see something really convincing coming out of these for me to want to go along. I'm not seeing it right now. Yeah, you know, I just did another scan of all the coins out there. There's not much that looks good, to be honest with you. And it's because, I mean, a lot of them look good against the dollar. But again, they look good against the dollar because Bitcoin looks great against the dollar. So this to me remains a Bitcoin story. Look at this chart. Beautiful uptrend. This is where the action is right now. So this is where I'm mostly going to focus my time and effort for the next sort of week or two. Looking for an eventual end to this rally, which again brings in probably a month or two of weakness. And then maybe the altcoins do well at that point. I don't know. But at this point, just looking at Bitcoin, looking to ride this one higher. I don't think this is a bad, if you did not get in leverage-wise, I don't think this is a bad spot to get back in. Because there is a move to over $10,000 that's available. But again, you want to give it room on the stop side if you do go long. Therefore, your position, now that this gap is pretty wide, would have to be fairly small. Again, you'd have to measure that. So you're only risking maybe, you know, one. Maybe in this position, you can do a 1.5% or even 2% because of the trend is so powerful. But again, you need to give it some room. That's the Bitcoin cycles update. I may even come out with another one tomorrow for the top 10. Top 10 is normally done on a Wednesday. So I might just do that tomorrow. It depends on the market. If the market has not really moved a whole lot tomorrow, then I'll leave that and I'll probably do it on Thursday. So it would be either tomorrow or Thursday for the next report. Leave me any questions you have below and have a great week.
