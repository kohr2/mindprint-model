Good morning Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas here on the 17th of June, Monday morning in New York. I hope you had a great weekend for the fathers out there. I hope it was a happy Father's Day. And today is the Monday is typically the full Bitcoin cycles report. I'll go over Bitcoin on the daily chart and also the weekly chart. And let's get stuck into it. So beautiful looking chart right here. We have six green candles on Bitcoin. The move is over around 13 or $1,400 move over just those six trading days. Obviously very bullish. We now have again a cross of the 10 day moving average back above and we have some good separation between the price and 10 day. To me, this again looks like it is beginning to make another run higher. Previous runs higher from pretty much the February lows or December lows have resulted in major moves. So one thing I want to stress very clearly is the trend. And the trend for those people who have been following me for a while, they know that trend is kind of one of the biggest things I like to respect and like to trade with. Never trying to go against the trend regardless of what some of the cycles may be telling us or any other technical analysis. Trend rules because trend is really price. And on a price chart looking at this right now, we have we had this sort of cluster up here. We had this spike here on May 30th. That to me was potentially a top early in a new cycle. So that was one thing I was watching out for looking at this coming back down. And then I was looking at possibly could have a retrace back to the 6400 area, consolidating, zooming out, consolidating this massive 180% gain. But it doesn't look like that's the case at the moment. And that's the reason why I went long on Fridays because it wasn't behaving like it was rolling over right here in this cluster. It looked like it could roll over from there, but it didn't. It moved higher here. And this is why at the 84, 100, it was around 83, 80 or so. That's why I said, well, this does not look to me like it's rolling over. If anything, it looks like it's continuing higher. And that's the reason why I wanted to get in right here back above the 10 day moving average and the 20 with some good volume. For me, that was a reason to get in. So the way I see this now from a cycle standpoint is I see here quick 54 days cycle low. Then we had somewhat of a, well, I wouldn't call it consolidation because we went on to make new highs, but then a pause just to take, take that in some profit taking again, consolidation. Then you look at the Bollinger bands getting really tight here or fairly tight at least. And now we've got this move here. Now we've, we've exceeded this, this level here, all these candles. We've even exceeded the spike that we saw on May 30th. So we're now well and truly clear of that area. And we are well above the 10 day moving average. We are now above the daily Bollinger bands. So to that, that's telling me that we are now going to experience, or we are in the midst of experiencing a move like this, a move out of a consolidation period. Even if I zoom out, here's another one right here, and then a move higher, another one here, move higher. And even earlier, we kind of saw it here as well. That's what I'm seeing from this. Obviously at some point, we're going to find a more significant top. We're going to find an intermediate level top. That's probably going to bring Bitcoin down for a month or even two. But the problem is everybody's looking for that as well, because they're afraid of being caught in a downtrend like that. And that's keeping them hesitant from getting long or getting long with any size or getting long for the for the longer term. And unfortunately, markets like this end up leaving so many people behind, even though they were expecting the end of a bear market, they were expecting maybe a new uptrend or a new four year cycle or a new new bull market. But the move has been so quick and so rapid over just three months period that they're just defensive by nature because they're just worried about or they remember the experience of 2018 so vividly that they don't want to get caught in something like that. And they're missing out on a big move like that. Again, this is why I keep saying over and over and over again for months now, you want to be denominated in Bitcoin when you're sitting idle. So when you're not when you're not sure which direction it's going, just sit in Bitcoin, right? You're in a bull market here. In a bull market, you don't want to be sitting completely on the sideline. I'm not saying you leverage yourself long or you trade, you know, leverage long like I've been in this last few days. But you at least sit and take advantage of the price appreciation that we're seeing and expect to see for the next one year or two years. Again, we will see those 20 or 30% declines. They will come. This was around about I think a 17 or 16% decline. We will see at one point a 30% decline. But I think it doesn't matter in the end because as you can see from this chart, eventually when that 30% decline comes, it's only going to bring us back to a previous level of consolidation before breakout. So we're only going to take sort of one step back. Think of it as three steps forward, one step back, three steps forward, one step back. If you're always worried about that one step back, then you're going to miss the three steps forward. So you know, one step back is only negating one step forward and you're missing out on those two steps. And that's why I keep saying, get that position, stay long, even if you're not leveraged and the leverage trades are only for extra BTC. So we're just trying to make some more Bitcoin above and beyond already the Bitcoin that we have and the Bitcoin that we've now seen almost a 200% gain in. Okay. So I think that's very important. You don't want to end up at the end of this bull market kind of missing a lot of the big move and somebody who's just been huddling on the side and going about their business, making much more than you. The goal here is to make more than a huddle strategy. Okay. Because if we can't make more than the huddle strategy, then what's the point? What's the point of exposing ourselves to risk, putting our capital at risk every day we trade or, you know, going in and out of all coins and back and forth and at the end of the day, not, uh, not, not far exceeding the strategy of a huddle account. So, um, that's why I say sit in Bitcoin when you do that. Um, I'm sorry about that. So looking at Bitcoin again at the daily chart. So I see this as around day 30 of the cycle, uh, based on this here being the cycle low in that case, if we're about to sort of punch higher and expand, you know, expand, uh, volatility here, the bands get wider and we get another move higher. It's, it's very difficult to determine how high this can go, but based on the recent history only, I'm not trying to get, uh, everybody super excited here, but based on some of these moves, um, we could see some pretty significant type of rallies. So, uh, 46% is one. Let's just say from kind of this breakout point here, another 50% there, right? Probably something similar down here. Let's just use those two as an example, and then take our price chart again, let's just say from this breakout and go 40% or even 50 close to say 45% for argument's sake. Now we're looking at sort of the $13,000 price range for a move higher. That might be aggressive. Um, you know, from a nominal standpoint, the numbers get bigger, of course, as you go higher. Um, so let's just say 40, 40% for argument's sake, that's 12,700 move from here. So that's, that's significant. That's huge. I don't want to be left behind. So I want to be leveraged long here like I am, but give it some room as well. At the same time, we don't want to get stopped out on us in a simple move back, looking at the candles three days before at the 8620 level. So maybe raising the stops up above break even now, and probably using this third day candle and then using kind of three candles back on the way up as a trailing stop. But once it gets going, as you can see from these previous moves, it doesn't really look back too often. So I'm hoping that the Bollinger Bands expand and this rides for maybe the next 10 to 12 trading days higher, get to a day 42 day 45 area, form a top drop, um, on for the cycle and then see where it goes from there. Um, obviously, you know, just protect yourself on the downside. It's all I'm saying. Uh, if you haven't gone in long, it's difficult to say, uh, when to get in here. Obviously we could pull back quite significantly. Let me see if I can kind of just zoom in a little bit and show you what that might look like. So, uh, looking at this again, you know, we could easily pull back to the 8700 area and then move higher again. That would still be well above the 10 day moving average and only pull us back almost to the lows of yesterday. Even if we look at Saturday, June 15th, the lows at 8620, like I said, we could pull back as close or as far as 8600 and still be in a nice uptrend that kind of be a little shaky out after these six green candles and then move higher. So if you want to get in long now on a leverage side, obviously, I think the position has to be much smaller taking into account the much wider stops that you have to employ to be able to sustain a, uh, you know, a pullback at this point. Otherwise you'd be just risking too much in my opinion. Um, but again, there is a decent amount of reward. If you are long, I don't think you give up your position here, even though it's almost up a thousand dollars since I posted my alert. Uh, I think you just want to try and, um, try and see if we can get a two or three or even $4,000 move off that alert and really bank some serious Bitcoin. That's just the way, um, that's the only reason why I would trade Bitcoin here and not just huddle that you want to take advantage of these really big moves and, uh, they can add 20 or 30% more Bitcoin to your account by doing that. So that's how I'm looking at Bitcoin at the moment. I'm staying patient, not looking at price, uh, all that often throughout the day. Once my positions are in, I kind of just say, okay, let the market, um, let the market show me what it wants to do. And then, you know, I, I take what's given, I guess. All right. I'm going to take a quick look at the weekly chart here. I think the weekly looks absolutely stunning, beautiful move off the, uh, the base here. This, this candle here is just gorgeous. The way it just broke out of this, this sort of foundation or this bottoming pattern here, didn't see a lower low, just fooled, uh, everybody. Even I was looking for a move up and then down to retest. Haven't seen anything like that. I think we have way too much separation now from, uh, the, this, the four year cycle low and the December lows to see anything close to these type of prices. I think we're looking now at a worst case scenario of a move back into this range. 6,400 to me looks like the absolute kind of worse, although I would maybe consider a 5,600 kind of to the top of this area or maybe the bottom of these candles. So the 55, 5,600 as a worst case scenario at some point in the future. But again, if we, if we get the type of move, I just outlined on the daily chart where it goes up to sort of that 13,000 area, then you can kiss the 5,000 range goodbye as well. Then we're talking about something like seven and a half, 8,000, 9,000 as the bottom on the next pullback. So, um, look again, the narrative here is that we're in a new four year cycle. The market is screaming higher. There is just so much demand behind Bitcoin. Obviously it's been accumulated heavily. There's just not enough supply to push down price or to hold price down. Um, I, I, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if this just goes and goes and goes and goes. Do not underestimate the power behind this move. Uh, this could just rocket, uh, not just rocket straight up as in a very, not like a 2017 move, but this could continue going up, sideways, up, sideways, up. We could be at 20,000 towards the end of the end of the year. And I wouldn't be surprised. It's not my primary outlook. It's not, um, it's not how I think the market should play out or would play out, but the way it's moved and rallied so far off the lows, I just can't discount the idea that, uh, Bitcoin is going to really surprise absolutely everybody, even the most of most bullish of analysts. So let's just say we get that move to 13,000. We consolidate for a number of weeks, then we get another move, consolidate. Then we get another move above 20,000. Now you're talking September, October, and you're already at 20,000 probably take a big pause at that point, maybe spend six months going sideways. I don't know, but I'm just outlining. This is not a prediction. This is just sort of saying to you, don't be too afraid of that big retracement or that 30% correction in a bull market. They will come and it will come at some point. Again, I can't tell you when, I don't know when, but don't be constantly looking for it to the point where it paralyzes you on the long term. That's really the main message I want to convey here as well. Um, then lastly, going to take a quick look at Litecoin because it's still the only other position and it's getting close here. It's back to almost a 20 day moving average, um, giving a little bit more room, not much left here, but, uh, it really needs to find support right here at the 20 day moving average. It's kind of broken. I wouldn't call it much of a trend line here to be honest. So I don't give that much, that trend line all that much respect, but at the same time I do respect the 20 day moving average in an uptrend. I don't like 10 day moving average being lost in an uptrend, but it was significant enough here. But 20 days, typically my stopping point, once price gets below the 20 day moving average, I find that the trend has already reversed and we're just looking at this in slow motion. So I'm getting close here to getting out of my position to so you're aware of it. Um, again, my target's up a 0.1, 0.02, but, um, I don't want to give up any more of the gains I already have getting in on the first breakout and then the second one here, uh, the gains have already been, uh, mostly, or when half of them have been erased already. So, uh, that's unfortunate, but that's just the way it goes. But of course losing the 20 day moving average right here would to me be a reason to start to get out. Okay. My friends, that's the Bitcoin cycles update. Any questions you have put them in the comments below next update or next report will be on Wednesday, which will be the top 10 market cap report as usual. Uh, again, thanks very much for being here and I'll speak to you soon.
