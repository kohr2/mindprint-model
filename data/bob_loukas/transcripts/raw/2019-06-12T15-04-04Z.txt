Hey Fintech members. Bob Lucas, with a midweek update. it is around 10: 50, so in the morning here, Eastern Time in New York, hope you're doing well. let's get into a quick update on what we're seeing in the cycles, and looking at gold first of all. we had a good drop Monday and Tuesday, coming off somewhat of a reversal on Friday. obviously a move to new highs for the for the year was very bullish. the rocket type move out of these lows was also extremely bullish. it confirmed the new weekly cycle was in play, confirming that we have, either right here or here, a first daily cycle. looks like we come back down into a half cycle low as far as I'm concerned- not definitive just yet, but we did have a pullback, a reversal I should say, from almost a touch of the 10-day moving average. that's typically a bullish sign in an uptrend. if this uptrend can continue, it looks like today we're seeing some follow-through. that may just be it, that two or three day move, and if this action is as bullish as I think, as it might be, that might be it and we may be able to see gold continue higher from this point up, test the highs again, test the resistance and maybe even pull out into sort of new territory that we haven't seen in quite a few years. if you roll back here you can see that of course jury's still out. we want to be a little cautious still long here, long on kind of a breakout of this declining trend line here. from the tops of these past four highs in the daily cycles, plenty of room left not to not to panic, even if we do reverse back, make a lower low, I think, as long as it stays up and above obviously this day eight high, but even above kind of the 13, 10, 13, 15 area, I think it's still overall fairly bullish and not something you want to panic out of positions with. and then looking at the miners, the miners have really recovered nicely. they also pulled back almost to the 10 day moving average and now almost back to new highs. so overall I think this all looks pretty good. I know the cut report was not good at all in the sense that it got pretty leveraged on the long side. it don't necessarily like that idea, but at the same time we know that you know if the market takes off then that can get even more extreme as well. so just keeping an eye on this overall. I do like the way it's shaping up and structured. so it's just a matter of just being patient, staying long in your positions and giving this chance to rally and continue higher. looking at the SMP, obviously we we came up to 10 and 10 day. I thought it would reverse lower. it has not. it has taken my stops out, as you know last week. now the question is: where is the high? can we move it to here? because we have now a higher high, but I still believe this area here is the 42 day cycle low. I do believe we still have a failed cycle. this here to me would be a impulse type move, a reactionary counter trend move, and I want to look for a swing here. so the lows on the spot index here is at 28.78 right now. we are trading slightly above that, but if we can close below that level, I think we have a swing in place and it does set up the opportunity to maybe try one more short- maybe not with such a larger position, but take one more short- and then the stop would be the candle here on 11th June, giving us a reasonable risk, short risk level here with a potential to come back down to exceed the lows set last week over here and to continue down into kind of the 2620- 2640 area for the eventual cycle low. keeping an eye on that. but the moment still too early. 10 day moving average is starting to come back up for a cross back above, so you've got to be a little cautious here. so looking for a closing swing to perhaps go short again. and then looking at crude oil: here crude oil continues the weakness and move back to the 10 day moving average is classic counter trend move and then got reversed. at that point had a wick down the bottom here today. that was pretty low, around the 5140 area, not far from recent lows. so this is all very bearish action but, um, kind of what you expect from crude in a declining phase. overall this looks to me as if crude does want to come down and take out the lows from June, the 5th of last week, and then continue the pattern lower. so I'm staying short on this one. don't want to leverage back in with some bigger position. took half the profit at this level last week or the week before, I think it was. have half a position still running. I think we let that go. the other thing that this affords us is the possibility that we can now focus on the highs set on Monday morning, June 10th, as a possible shortened stop on the profit position position that's open still, although that may be a little too tight, a little aggressive, although probably not a bad thing. if price does come back up from this level and take out that June 10th high, then it's possible that we now have a bottom in place and we could be looking higher. cycles don't call for that. cycles do not look anything like this. being a daily cycle low. this looks more like the half cycle low, so it shouldn't really get back above that level. but in a half cycle we could get one more move up to exceed that level and then we could come down and continue the decline lower. so that's why, with a pretty profitable open position still, I want to give a little more room, just in case it comes up and makes a slightly higher high. I think that 20 day moving average getting above that would be definitely a call to get out. and then also, being a little more conservative, this wick here, the top of that wick, which is at around about 5660, I think that is definitely you get out sign. you don't want to be kind of short above that level. I think you're just giving up gains for no reason at that point. I'm also bullish on gold because I do see the chart breaking down on the dollar. we are due a daily cycle low. here's the failed cycle. we are now due a cycle low, something like this, and that may actually already be it. we may just be looking at a little more upside action, maybe to this level here and then a continuation lower. if that were to happen, gold's going to get a significant tailwind. it's going to help, obviously, but for now the dollar is in a failed state. we are late in the weekly or investor cycle, so there's no reason why we should not expect a very left translated cycle here now in this, what should be probably the final daily cycle, something like that, and then move down over the next three to four weeks into the eventual investor cycle low. that's what I'm looking at for the dollar. hope you enjoyed the midweek update. I'll have the report out this weekend. all the best, thank you.
