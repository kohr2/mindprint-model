Good morning Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas. Wednesday morning here in New York, May the 8th. Hope you're doing really well. This is your top 10 market cap report for the week, covering the top 10 coins by market cap, of course, excluding Tether. Before I get into that, some news to talk about and briefly just give you my thoughts and ideas, essentially around the Binance hack. I think first and foremost, I think it really just tells us that crypto and Bitcoin specifically, it's all about sovereignty and being the bearer of your own asset and controlling your own assets. And the moment you relinquish that control, anything can potentially happen. Now, obviously in this case, users are not going to lose any funds, but on some lesser known exchanges or just giving your Bitcoin to anybody for any reason, whether it's for interest purposes or for loaning or staking, whatever the case may be, if you don't hold those private keys, then you're at the mercy of the party that does hold and control those keys. I think that's a very important fact. Obviously, we want to trade, we want to do certain things with these assets, but you want to just be aware that you want to limit your exposure to any one party or any one vector and keep that risk defined. I like to, and I've said this in the past, I don't like to risk more than say 10% of my crypto portfolio on any one party or any one exchange. That's why I use, I actually use Binance, but I use, sorry, I use BitMEX and Derebit as well on the future side. So, and then obviously I hold most of my crypto on my Trezor as well. So, you know, again, just limit your exposure, be aware that these things can happen. Security is first and foremost, the most important thing. And in terms of price, it didn't have the impact I thought it might, especially this late in the cycle. I'll go over that in a second with the Bitcoin cycle. And I don't think in the end it's going to have much because the industry is getting somewhat immune to, you know, honeypot exchanges being hacked. And that's just the nature of, you know, of the market and the ecosystem when you put in a significant amount of assets in one place that are bearer based, meaning that if you get access to those coins, you now own those coins. There isn't any recourse that you can take. So it's not surprising. I think the industry knows that. I think the industry is more mature than this at the moment. So that being said, it's more about personal risk and safety and what you do with it. I did actually believe though, that the news, not that, not that the news was necessarily important, but the news would create a top in the Bitcoin cycle. But you know, the daily candle looks hot right here. It's full. Even when I go out to the, or back down to the four hour chart. So we had that overnight dip came all the way back down to kind of 5,600. This here was kind of really my stop area, 5,500. Anything below that to me tells me that the cycle has broken down, but this is not broken down, at least not yet. Still looks pretty strong for solid four hour candles there, making its way back up towards the highs for the cycle and for the year. It doesn't mean it couldn't roll over from here, but it still has, and it still maintains that uptrend. 10 day moving average is still well above the 20. So overall, everything still looks pretty good for Bitcoin and could well make that push to that $6,000 area. It got close yesterday, but 6,000 and above in this sort of final sprint. Now this still is kind of, you know, my expectation for some time now, you know, a nicely right translated cycle. We are on day 45. Day 44 is a high so far for the cycle, which is yesterday. Another three or four days to a day 50 high would be sort of, you know, May 11th, May 12th. So this weekend or consensus week next week could be the top for the cycle. Again, the market is trending higher. We have right translated cycle. We have higher highs, higher lows. So we've got to respect the upside potential that the market still holds. We never know when you have a trend like this, if it can overshoot or if it overshoots to the upside, that's also very possible. Just don't short a market like this. We don't short unless we see a clear top, a breakdown, and then a couple of lower lows and lower highs. So the new downtrend established before looking to short anything like this. So for now, either stay long or be on the sidelines. It still has room for the upside, but again, it's getting late in the cycle now. And, um, we haven't had a day 44 high for, well, I think you have to go back to the bull market. Day 34 high is probably the, the highest we won we have, uh, in 2018. Then you have to go back here to November, 2017 to see a day 54 high, uh, day 48 high, uh, in September of 17. So right translated cycles with the top occurs near the end of the cycle is a good development. And again, um, gives me confidence to say that the four year cycle low is in for December based on the fact that we have right translated cycles right now, but again, just be worried to be concerned. I should say that, um, not concerned, but be aware that, uh, cycles are an ebb and flow, um, you know, depiction of price. And we have 44 days, 45 days higher, we could expect and should expect. So 15 days lower at some point to make a 60 day cycle. Uh, this is what it probably would look like or something like it looked like so far. It's been pretty accurate to, um, pretty consistent with past right translated cycles. Um, so let's look for a retrace back down to the 4,000 to 4,500 area would be logical or reasonable, uh, maybe even higher now, because we do have a consistent push towards 6,000. The retrace may be something like 46 or 47 as well. So not so steep, um, but that's the common we'll face that when it comes probably beginning some point next week. Um, so that's the Bitcoin analysis, the update for this week. Let's go into the top 10 by market cap. So with Ethereum still, still not a whole lot to get excited about here. It did well against the dollar. Let's put that up here real quick. Um, you know, did, you know, managed to rally back up, but then Bitcoin also rallied. So Bitcoin and Ethereum chart here, excuse me, that's ETC. Here it is here, Ethereum, Bitcoin. So we still have new lows here, uh, for the year, in fact, against Bitcoin. So that's still showing us that all coins are not catching a bid right now. And that's been the case since mid-March, um, since sort of, uh, Bitcoin started dominating Ethereum. And then also the altcoins still have that December low here in focus. And I don't think we get down there, although we are starting to approach that and get kind of low there. And we do have a Bitcoin 60 day cycle on the horizon. So this is a little bit of a concern, but I, again, I think we're going to hold those lows. Maybe we do a double test. Um, again, uh, when Bitcoin's falling, the alts and Ethereum may actually, uh, still outperform, but in general, they have proven to go down when Bitcoin goes down. So if we get something like that, we can get a double bottom with Bitcoin 60 day cycle and then we can rally higher. Um, so again, nothing, nothing here to ride home about, nothing to get excited about. This is a downtrend. If you look at this chart clearly with the, um, with an open mind, you'll see that January 4th was the top and you have another one here in February. And then since then it seems like the downtrend has been accelerating. So stay away from this for now. There isn't much to go on here. The 60 day cycle low coming up probably no two or three weeks away is most likely going to provide the best opportunity to be going along for Ethereum. XRP continues its, its woes down, riding the lower Bollinger bands now in sort of no man's land, no real support, only area where you can maybe find some support and people probably honing in on this level here that occurred in September. Um, only because that's a, it's a sticking point here and it looks similar to the recent action. People are probably focusing on that, on that and not wanting to come in and support this market until price comes down to that level. That means still no 20% to go before it gets down to that point. I don't see any reason why I'd want to own something like this. Um, I don't see it as a value play now, long, long-term holders may want to consider it for that reason. Um, but no reason to rush as far as I'm concerned. This again, this is nothing to like necessarily about this chart. Uh, also against the dollar, nothing, nothing great here to write home about. And then against Bitcoin, um, it's, it's probably trying to find a bottom at some point, but it's now being since December, a consistent decline down. I think it'll have its day and when it does, it will rally sharply, but we can't be positioned, hoping that it's going to rally at any time. Now, if it does come down over the next couple of weeks and touch this level here around the 4,100 to 4,200 and kind of look like a double bottom, it's possible to then take a trade idea or a trade setup, I should say on the fact or the idea that the market's looking at a double bottom and we'd want to see evidence of a swing. We would want to see it come back above the 10 and 20 day moving average. We'd also want to see this 10 day. If you zoom in here, you'll see the 10 days being below the 20 day, essentially the entire ride all the way since January. So you want to see a change in that to show that the short term trend is above the intermediate term trend. And then we can maybe look to buy something, uh, on the swing, you'd have to give up around 20% of the move back up to confirm that's in the trend change. But if you look at this entire move, it really hasn't made that switch and trend up, uh, since December or so. So any move higher now and a swing where the 10 comes back above the 20, it's probably going to be telling us that the trend has changed for, for XRP. And we could be in for a more intermediate uptrend, but again, until that happens, it's only speculation. Stay away from it. Bitcoin cash looks like it's done for that little mini spurt that it had higher. It, uh, almost doubled in price, which is great. It doesn't look like it on this chart, but, um, it looks like now it did kind of a double top. It's come back down, broken the trend higher, and now it looks like it might be rolling over again. Uh, again, it's going to be interesting to see how all these top 10 coins perform and behave when Bitcoin is scheduled to come into its own 60 day cycle. Although, um, some of these may hold up fairly well, but in general, I think something like Bitcoin cash will not. And I think we're going to get a retrace back down to this sort of level here, which could be somewhat of a flaw for Bitcoin cash. Uh, I think the other thing that's helping or holding this up somewhat is the fact that Bitcoin SV, which was a fork of this, uh, or the fork created both these coins. I think that's losing value. And then a lot of that value is most likely going to be coming into something like Bitcoin cash being it's, it's, it's, it's fork or it's, uh, it's sort of brother, so to speak. Um, it's probably, it's probably supporting Bitcoin cash a little more than the price is telling us at this point. All right. EOS is another one that was looking so great for the longest time, but now we have a breakdown in the chart. Um, I did put in this trend line here thinking if we break back above that, it'd be a time to maybe get back long, but it's actually broken down even further. It's lost this March point here, which was a buy the dip opportunity came back up at that point. Now we're in the downtrend. So now, uh, again, these are, these top tens, uh, and avoid have been for a while since April, like Ethereum, uh, because one Bitcoin is dominating them, but two, um, you know, that they've kind of showed us that they are want to retrace a lot of the moves from December and above. So this is probably already around about 30 to 40% back, uh, of, of the rally it's had since December. It's given back a lot. I don't think it's telling us that, uh, we're going to be going back down to new lows or anything like that, of course, but I think it's telling us that, uh, this is a profit taking event in place. Accumulation occurred, but now there's just, uh, you know, some distribution going on and may take some more time again than the coming Bitcoin cycle low in a couple of weeks, probably when we're going to maybe a few days before that, but probably the next time that we have any opportunity for a lot of these top tens to rally back up. And like coins always also in the exact same position. If you look at this chart, it's beautiful on the way up. I'm going to just draw in very quickly, a couple of sort of low points here and you get to see the step up manner in which Litecoin went up. Um, but now if we draw this across, see, we have a breakdown in that pattern. So we have the top and then you see clearly the 10 and 20 day moving average. I like to quote 10 and 20 day moving average a lot, not because I necessarily trade with that, but it gives me a good idea on the short term and intermediate trend. And you see on the way up tens, mostly above the 20 on the dips, which are by the dips, you kind of get a touch or maybe slightly, a slight, slight crossover on that. But once you get a crossover and a clear separation of the 10 and 20 and the 10 now goes below the 20, you know, you're in a downtrend. Um, so this is something we need to avoid for a while. This next cluster here is probably what I think we're looking at for now. And if we can get down to that point, that could be where maybe that corresponds with again, Bitcoin's upcoming cycle lower, but that's maybe a point where it finds some support and then maybe can establish kind of a, a low for the cycle and then move higher again. So not much here to go on. Uh, I think Bitcoin is the dominant asset for right now and it looks like a lot of, um, you know, a lot of actions moving away from the top tens and into Bitcoin. So last week, the Binance coin was pretty much the only one that was showing, uh, strength against Bitcoin and holding its uptrend in place. Um, that seemed like it was already breaking down even before the hack, this couple of, a couple of candles here clearly, uh, related to the news of the hack and that sent it sharply lower. But if you look at this, it was already breaking down in my opinion. It had, it's looked similar to the Litecoin chart only a week or so, uh, behind. So you had this bull bull trap right here. It's come back down, but then fail to continue higher again. And that's where you see the 10 days starting to cross below and have some separation. And now this hack has, uh, not really helped. So I think what we're going to see is something similar to Litecoin where we come down, we're going to break below that point. And then I think what we'll see is this cluster here, maybe these lows become into play very quickly. So this here is not a good looking chart. I think this is still a short, even though it's extended to the downside, but if we, I'm not sure what that corresponds with, but if we take this cluster here, I think that's my downside target right here for the upcoming day cycle. That's quite a, quite a way lower for this point. So that could be a, could be very aggressive, but if you consider how far it's come in such a short period of time as well, retracing back to that level is also not unheard of, even though it looks, looks like it's not possible. All right. So Binance is definitely an avoid and it's also a short opportunity, especially on a balance. If we can get a bounce back to the 10 day moving average, wherever that may be, uh, in the next couple of days, I would say that it's short. XLM is one I don't like as well pointed out last week. I think this is rolling over. You can see that in the 10 and 20, you can see that in the break of this uptrend that we had, even though it wasn't a strong uptrend, that was the first warning. The fact that it was not, uh, showing any relative strength versus not only Bitcoin, but the rest of the market that's XLM versus the U S dollar versus, uh, that's XMR XLM versus BTC is like a different chart altogether. It's a different animal. Um, so this here is extremely bearish. Uh, this has lost extreme amount of value. So I would definitely continue to avoid and stay away from this. Now ADA, look at this. This is, uh, this is quite impressive. Um, that it's managed to come all the way back down to even well below the neckline breakout and back down to this two spots in February. This just tells us, um, how much of a flight that's been away from this initial move. I think a lot of people, uh, this, this chart is similar to a lot of the other charts where it had this really big run 200, 300% up. It wasn't until kind of the end that everybody got really excited and started jumping in and then they got caught in this move. This just illustrates that if you're not in early and some of these big moves, you don't want to be in at all because it just makes it very difficult to hold a position. And I think many people got caught in this downtrend and then didn't want to believe that the trend was not going to continue higher, held on, held on, held on. And now they're puking out all those positions right in this area. It's sad, but it's, uh, it's something I see all the time. It's repeatable. You want to, if you, if you don't identify the trend earlier, then just don't, just don't go for a void and you'll find the next opportunity. Uh, they're just not worth chasing a move like this. Um, we were able to make a good amount of coin. This one was probably one of the best performers for me personally, um, on this trade, taking a couple of positions, uh, one early on here and then one here at the breakout and getting out well before the top and only closing out, um, you know, the last one on the sort of the breakdown here. So that's just a lesson. Hopefully now we can start to look for a low. Uh, let's see if these two lows here in February and March hold, if they do, and we can get a reversal, this could be a good opportunity to buy. I have an alert set kind of on this trend line. That's going to be around about where the 20 day moving average is going to be. And in between the 10 and 20 day moving average, come back up, form a swing. And that could be an opportunity to buy. Okay. Tron, Tron has a lot of attention. It had obviously an amazing run more than, uh, more than doubled. And again, like ADA, like many of these coins, it's giving back all those gains coming back to the initial kind of breakout point. I think this goes further down. I think this gets into this sort of bottom channel that, uh, was established between August and December. I think it, it, well, it could reverse from here. It looks like it's trying to do that, but I think it may fail again when Bitcoin makes its scheduled cycle low in the next couple of weeks. I think that's roughly around the time period where Tron makes its low. And then on a reverse, also higher, this may be one you'd want to buy as well. So there's going to be some opportunities coming up in these top tens, but they still need a little more work and they certainly need to show us, um, some evidence of a price change, a price trend change, and a swing higher before we even want to consider getting long. Don't try and pick bottoms in a downtrend like this until the market, until the asset or the price tells you or shows you that's okay. It's just not worth doing that. So avoid just trying to pick one because you're like, say you're like, like Tron or you're like ADA. It's kind of one of your pet favorites. Don't try and buy a bottom just because you think, well, this could be it. This should be it. These downtrends are long and they're arduous and painful. And it's just a matter of, it's just better served if you wait for that turn and wait for the evidence to get in. You'll be more better rewarded. You'd have a nice entry. You would also have a clear place for you to place your stop at the lows. So it gives you the setup that you need to execute correctly. Okay. Dollar market cap value, um, in dollars is holding up. Okay. That's because BTC is doing well, uh, against BTC. However, most of these coins are not doing well, as I've shown in the top 10, that same type of chart pattern goes all the way out to all the other old coins as well. So against the dollar, we're doing well because of Bitcoin, if Bitcoin does drop and it's scheduled to drop into a 60 day cycle low, the total market cap will decline for sure. And some of those charts will look even worse. The question becomes how do the alts in the top 10s perform versus Bitcoin while Bitcoin is dropping? If they can hold their ground, then some of those charts will look fairly decent and should, before Bitcoin makes its cycle low, should begin to make moves against Bitcoin and come and start maybe, you know, forming some swing lows and some new uptrends. But until then, I think the takeaway from today's report is that we need to be cautious. Don't try and pick bottoms, uh, being in Bitcoin or cash is by far and has been for the last month, the best, um, the best course of action that also corresponds with the reason why I haven't had, had few trade alerts issued, fewer trade alerts, because I don't see the opportunities. So I'm not going to trade for the hell of trading and the sake of trading. Uh, I keep my capital preserved and I've lost nothing in this last month, even though the shards look horrible. So, um, hopefully that's a good lesson for you as well. Just trade, trade, trade the strength, trade the trends more than anything else. Again, leave me, um, your coin requests for Friday's lightning report until then happy trading and all the best.
