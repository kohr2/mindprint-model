Hey, good afternoon or good evening Fintat members. It's Bob Lucas, Wednesday evening or around 5.45 Eastern. Hope you're doing really well. This is your midweek update. So gold is kind of giving us a little bit of trouble here, not painting a very clear picture on where it wants to go. Silver made new lows the last few days, so did the miners, but gold itself is kind of hanging in there and it's giving us a couple of alternative little views here. So by that, I mean this I thought would be the half cycle low. I did not trust any move come back up and are short of that again. And we came back down to double test the bottom here from April 23rd and not come lower. While at the same time, if you look at silver, it did come down and make a significant new low. So that tells me this is still part of the same cycle coming down. But in gold, we did not get a new low. So this is still probably the, well, not probably. It is kind of the lowest point of the cycle. And now could be looking at a day three or day four cycle. And the fact that we're back over the 10-day moving average, the 10-day moving average is now starting to cross over the 20 almost. This is kind of like the, not kind of the action you want to see at the end of a investor cycle low. Now, again, I still want to maintain an overall somewhat biased picture here because I did not see a huge or a decent capitulation like I want to see on the weekly chart. This looks fairly tame still. The only thing that tells me that we may be coming back up now is the fact that this has gone on for just so long. If you really look at when this started back in August, it looks like we're going to get a full kind of year out of this before seeing any real cycle low. This is definitely something we have not seen in a very long time. I don't know if this kind of midpoint here points to some type of ICL that just doesn't look obvious on the chart. I don't know, to be honest with you, but that's why I'm kind of like dismissing the cycle count on the investor cycle to some extent only because we just don't have anything remotely close to an ICL before. And when you have, you know, eight months or nine months of what looks like one investor cycle, then why not more, right? Why not longer? We just don't know at that point. Something different is going on, that's for sure. So I don't see why we couldn't necessarily continue this lower if we draw kind of a trend line. Let's see if we can draw that in here. Let's intersect a couple there. So if you look at that, actually, I think we can even take this price point here almost. So almost since the top, you look here at today's candle, it did exceed that very slightly just for a brief moment, I believe, and then reversed lower. So I think now the top of today's candle at 12.91.60, at least on the spot here, is probably a point where if gold continues higher, it's going to easily break kind of the declining trend line, should be well above the 10-day moving average at that point. And then it's probably safe to say that we have an ICL in place. I just can't buy, I can't get long this right now until I see something up in this area, which means probably almost back above 1300. That gives up quite a bit of room. Unfortunately, that is just a function of the fact that we have not seen a decent drop down here to give me the confidence to say, okay, that type of capitulation is the ICL, and now I can buy a swing with confidence. Out of gold now from the short standpoint that was in from last week. Just looking at this at the moment, I don't see going short again. It is possible though, if we do see some more downside action here. So if we see some more kind of continuation lower, and I see stocks kind of roar higher in the third cycle, if we kind of see something like this, then I may be tempted to take a short again, because I would then be looking at this being a confirmed daily cycle low. Then we'll be looking at a, let's draw this in, a day four high again, like the last cycle. And then we would have a full daily cycle lower into late May, maybe early June. And that one based on kind of where it's at now, I could easily get down to 1230 or so. So no, no clear cut evidence either way. We have to just go with the flow here and go and respect the price action. I think if we respect the price action, we still see a downtrend. Only difference is again, that we are due or overdue by a long way for an ICL event. When it comes to stocks, I think I was very much spot on from last week, predicting that that big red candle would be the day 36 top. We clearly have a top down. There's no question of that. I went on day 41 here. We've retraced all the way down to the lower Bollinger bands. As I expected, we now could have yesterday's candle, which was a pretty severe drop. Ended up marking the daily cycle low. We just don't know today. We didn't see any real follow through. I did want to see a lower low today to set up a pretty easy swing. We did not get that. I think tomorrow though we may even end up opening lower again and going much deeper into sort of below the Bollinger bands. And then that could mark the day 42 cycle low perfectly in the timing band after a good kind of six day decline at that point would be over a hundred points. Kind of the decline you want to see in a second daily cycle after a good move like this. And I think that sets up a beautiful swing trade. Even if, even if by some reason, uh, the equity market is not preparing to go on to new highs in the third cycle, it's still all offer. If we can get in a reasonable point, offer a good opportunity to pick up kind of, uh, you know, a 4% move, which, you know, if leveraged a little bit could, uh, could be a decent little move. So this is what I'm looking at now. It could be as early as tomorrow, although there's no chance of getting a swing until Friday. Of course, we have to make a new low first, unless we come back and exceed this candle here on the index, which is 2913. I moved above 2913 from here, I think is a buy for sure. That was obviously a swing, but that would also get us back above the 10 day moving average. And I think that's definitely a buy at this point. So from now, this is going as planned. I don't think this sell-off is anything to be concerned about this is, this is an expected second daily cycle, well, well, clear of any sort of, uh, cycle failure from the first daily cycle here, or even kind of maybe this midpoint here or early midpoint in the cycle, still well above that point as well. So no real danger here. I think this is a buy as soon as it makes it's clear. It has evidence that to turn. So crude oil, I did mention the weekend report that it was quite a few days ahead of equities in terms of its sell-off. And that's why I thought equities were right behind and on its heels. So this has been like a nine, 10 day decline now below the Bollinger Bands a couple of times. I think this may have found bottom here on the 6th of May on Monday and I'm positioned long now, just a little concerned that it may give us one big drop and stop us out. Uh, if that's happens, then we can buy another reverse. We'll try it a second time, but this is primed now and ready to maybe form that swing low, get back, back above 63. And then if it does that, it can easily make a move back to 66 and then even 70 in the third daily cycle. So overall, I think this is kind of expected, uh, going to plan just a matter of now finding, making sure it's found that low and continuing higher. And lastly, finishing up with a dollar here again, continued see-saw action between cycle lows and cycle highs. It's pretty clear. It's coming down now into the next sort of cycle low. I think this action here is still part of this one cycle that started back on April 12th. So it is due a low could get that little drop as I indicated last week into a drop here into the cycle low, then another rally. We just don't know where this of course goes, but looks like we are fairly now deep into the investor cycle. So we'd want to see these cycles begin to form fairly left translated and to begin to decline down towards the next ICL. Uh, I'm thinking that this next rally here could pop that gold down into this ICL. So maybe we get something like this, right? Something even sharper, uh, where it makes a double top that could help over maybe a week or two, get gold down into the ICL and then get it going in a new IC at just as this does a pretty significant sort of one month decline into the next ICL. Okay guys, that's the wrap for the midweek update. I hope you enjoyed it. Of course, always as coming out with a full report on a Sunday. Actually, uh, let me do a quick Bitcoin analysis. I know some members have been asking for Bitcoin. So let me give you a quick rundown on where we stand on Bitcoin. So Bitcoin is on day 46 of a 60 day cycle and it's currently showing us a day 44 high. This was on, uh, on the seventh. So yesterday, um, it's looking really strong. It's it's so for people who don't follow it, it's got a nice uptrend. December looks like it's a four year cycle low. We have a couple of cycles flatlined, then we popped out. And now we're now we're showing the first right cycle for Bitcoin since late 2017. Of course, when we had that parabolic bull market move every other daily cycle or 60 day cycle since has formed pretty much left translated and shown us a top at or before day 30. So you can see those yet day 34 was the most sort of furthest, um, furthest top from, from the low that came, but even that was a very long 84 day cycle. So it still ended up being fairly a left translated. You have to really go back here to the September and November peaks in 2017 to see a right translated cycle. And I think this is just telling us that Bitcoin is now out of its bear market low. It's probably going to come back over the next few months and restart to retest some of the lower areas. I don't know if it gets all the way back down to the December low. So right now, um, I've just exited a couple of long trades myself sitting flat, waiting for a, probably the beginnings of a breakdown now. Um, but right now it's still strong considering there was a Binance hack yesterday. I'm sure many of you heard about that, that typically in a bearish or bear market would have sent Bitcoin scrambling or down, you know, eight to 10%. It went down very briefly and now is very close to the highs for 2019. So this is showing some good strength overall positive action, but again, it's kind of late in the cycle now to be getting too bullish, even though I think it may pop over the $6,000 mark up towards 61, 62, where it's going to find, I believe it's 60 day cycle high and then come down sharply and sort of stop a few people out. How far back this comes, of course, nobody knows. I don't know if I want to be shorting this all that much now that we seem to have a nice uptrend in play. I'll probably be more hedging than anything else. Or if I do short, it would be on a good opportunity that presents itself only after it's clearly, it's clearly topped. So it's come up, it's come down and then maybe come back up a little bit. At that point, I would look potentially for a short opportunity, but right now there isn't one here. So this looks overall very bullish for Bitcoin, not so much again in the short term, but in the intermediate term, this is a very positive looking trend. Okay guys, thank you very much and I'll speak to you soon.
