Hello, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas. It is around midday here in New York on Thursday. I hope you're all doing really well. I have a brand new mic set up. I bought a pretty high-end sort of podcaster set up. So I'm hoping that the sound quality has improved greatly with this. It was a significant investment. And another announcement is that I will be away for four days visiting Texas with a few friends, leaving tomorrow morning and getting back on Monday night. So I will not have an update beyond this one until Tuesday of next week. So five days from now. If I do find some downtime and if I do see any action in the markets while I'm away, I do have my laptop and I probably will get on board and do an alert. I may even do a surprise update as a post. Just letting you know, however, that don't be surprised if you do not see an update until Tuesday. So let's go into Bitcoin here and see if we have any updates to kind of the analysis I presented on Tuesday. Firstly, a few people sort of seem to be a little concerned. I've seen it in the emails. I've seen it on Twitter on what this pullback means. And when I look at the chart, I really don't see a pullback. I see a sideways move. And I think all that means is that we are consolidating this big candle here launched as we kind of did before that. And that is kind of normal if the cycle is moving higher at this point to get a sideways move back into the Bollinger Bands and get ready for kind of the next move. So that is nothing to be concerned about. Again, the only thing I do want to be a little concerned about is the fact that we're already up to day 15. And, you know, we are about $500, $600 off the bottom, the cycle low. Now, that's not a lot. But when you consider that this move here wasn't, it certainly was better than what we've got so far. But this itself was only a nine day move. And if I go in and get my profit tool, I think I had it before, didn't I? Price range. Okay, so, you know, we had a 35% rally here to the peak. And let's see what we have currently. Nothing close just yet. But we do have a 20% move already off the bottom in 15 days. Not a whole lot. It would be the going back over time, it would be kind of the least amount that we've seen, I believe. Maybe this one here over 27 days was less of a rally. But when you look at the past cycles, you'll see that these were, these were much bigger rallies earlier in the bear market. In fact, each one appears to have only had a significantly less rally as the bear market progressed. So there's a chance here that we still, you know, we're still in a bear market, you know, there's, we think, well, I think that this cycle might have been the bear market low. But I don't know, I don't have any confirmation just yet, because I don't have at least one higher high to pin my hopes on. All I have right now is one lower, sorry, one higher low at this point, really want to see a move. Let me remove that. I really want to see a move above the December 24th candle to get even remotely excited about this being a bear market low. So we just have to be a little cautious here. Obviously, I'm long, I'm long with decent amount of size, in fact, too. But I'm not married to the position in the sense that if it does break down from this point, and continue some type of bear market deep into March and April, and deep below the $3,000 level, I would be surprised, to some extent, but not shocked, right, because we are in this downtrend. And markets are just cruel like that. You can have one viewpoint, and you should always have a viewpoint that, especially if you're trading or have a position, you should be fairly confident or comfortable in that position, but you should also be prepared for the alternative scenario. And without that real, you know, bottoming confirmation at the moment, I'm still in my back of my mind saying, okay, where can I be wrong? And where I could be wrong is when I first see a break below, back below this level, I wouldn't necessarily be wrong there. I'd be a little worried, but I'd be wrong here at that blue line here, which is kind of this cluster. Anything below that really negates this high, high, high sort of process, right? We really want to kind of get, let's actually draw it from here. So this is kind of the first high of the cycle. This is the first sort of low. Here's the next high we just put in. So really in theory, you want to have the next kind of low form above this line here. And that's why I say breaking below that line, I start to get a little worried. I may even take some of the extra leverage that I have, take that off. But below this line here, I'm pretty much out and I'm gone. I may even be considering shorting at that point, certainly shorting below this line here, because that now is our cycle low. So really, I haven't, having much of an update for you since Tuesday's update, I went into pretty, pretty good detail on Tuesday. I advise you to, to look back over that video again, if you did, if you missed it for whatever reason, or if you just want to refresh on where I stand. This is kind of the same action. This is just two or three candles moving sideways. It doesn't negate the bullish narrative. It doesn't make it any more bearish in any way. And I think if I flip over to some of the other charts, let's look at Ethereum to the dollar, same type of thing. We, you know, we rallied two big bars, that's great. And that is a 10, more than 10, 50, almost 20% move. So to see three candles moving sideways, that's perfectly normal, perfectly healthy. Ethereum to Bitcoin, again, this is, this is looking like a flag. That's bullish as well. Litecoin, I think it's going to show the, well, Litecoin's even more bullish because it's still, it has more rapidly expanding Bollinger Bands and price is moving and testing the upper Bollinger Bands as it expands. So Litecoin continues for me to show some good strength, even though it's down, you know, 8% right here. That's normal when you've got an asset like this that really likes to push the boundaries on the upside and the downside as well. Excuse me. One update is the Monero position I had, I know, stopped out. So we had a stop at break even, didn't lose anything. And this is a perfect example on how I sort of try and attempt to trade all the time. I don't like losing on my trades. And this one gave me an opportunity when it broke out to put in a stop at the break even point. And I did, it almost came back and tested here. Then it rallied well. I thought, okay, well, this is a chance now. This may actually prove to be a good trade. And then it's reversed since. And now it's down, right? So if you got into this position, you should be out and you should be out break even, no harm, right? No foul. Getting out break even is great. There was no reason to let it come back and result in a loss because it had some decent gains early on as well. So that's just one good lesson on how I trade and system advice for you. Pull up your stops as fast as you can, especially when the position affords you that opportunity. Get up there and start closing that gap because, yes, even though your risk is defined. So when you get into a trade, you say to yourself, I want to risk, let's just say for argument's sake, 1% of my capital. You define what that risk point is and you go into the trade. So that's your worst case. It should be your worst case. But that's still 1%, right? Why give up 1% if you can get away with raising the stop if it does not impact the overall objective of the trade? And so what I mean by that is if you get in right away to a trade and you have your defined stop and you have your profit target, you're not going to raise that stop almost immediately unless you get some good cushion on the profit side, paper profit side. So if a trade is moving forward and progressing like you expected it, then you can start to bring up the bottom. It doesn't have to go all the way to break even right away, but you can start to bring it up and start to narrow that 1% risk gap that you defined early on. So even if it means risking half a percent halfway through the trade, that's great. It's better than 1%. But when the trade gets to the point where it's showing some positive action, then you start to say to yourself, well, if it reversed here, I went back below my entry, is it still the setup that I envisioned when I first got in? That's the question you always have to ask yourself. Is it going to invalidate the setup even by going back below my entry? And if the answer is yes, and I think it will be a lot of the time, then that's when you want to be saying to yourself, okay, well, if it's going to invalidate the original goal of the trade, then pull up my stop, right? Getting out with break even losses often, you'll find that it actually feels pretty good to not be losing on some of these trades. And then when the good one comes along, you're going to let it ride and it's going to be a good winner for you. So it's just a little bit of a tip for you today, considering the markets aren't doing too much, throwing a little kind of lesson of how I like to trade and pull up my stops as fast as possible. But of course, you all know you must have a stop on any position. Don't let any position ruin your portfolio, ruin your capital. There's been many cases where I've had emails or questions from members and they say something like, well, I'm in XYZ position and I really love it. It's great. I can see it's going to be good, but I'm down 18% on the position and I went all in or I went in with half my capital. So they're down 10% of their overall position and they still believe in it, but they're too deep into the position now, too deep into a loss to want to realize that loss. And realizing a loss is not the end of the world because you're working on hope that it's going to recover. If the original thesis for getting into the trade has now busted and it's gone, why the hell are you going to be in the trade? Just get out and live another day, take your loss, take your medicine, put it down as a lesson and experience and then move on. But the lesson there is never let a trade get away from you. There's always going to be another one. There'll be another one tomorrow and the day after the next week and next month. Don't get married to a position and to want a single idea because once it gets away from you without a stop, you're going to find it very hard to close that position as well. So now I'm going to quickly just go through some of the other coins to see if there's been any sort of update. ADA still looking constructive here. It's actually sort of come back to this 10 day moving average. I don't know if I want to position yet unless it sort of breaks above this trend line here, which is kind of like a neckline and inverse head and shoulders. I think if this breaks, then it's got some room to really move. Let's just see. It's, you know, it's got some room. So this may take a while to develop, but if it can kind of break above that, then I think it has the potential to at least get up into this sort of area here, which was a big cluster before breaking down in the bear market. So patience on this one. I don't see a reason necessarily getting in. The other option is, you know, I don't really love trend lines like this, but you could kind of get in here because it had dropped quite a bit and use this trend line as a stop. Not my cup of tea, but for some people it might be. And then let's go through the list here. XLM showing somewhat of a possible round of bottom. But again, I said that this one was not showing relative strength because it had recent lows as opposed to December lows. So I want to stay away from this one as well. And then Bitcoin SV or this one, I don't even want to bother with. It's just continuing lower. It didn't even show any type of bounce this last week and two weeks when everything else went higher. There was pretty much every asset, every coin on my list did something except for Bitcoin SV. So that really tells you and shows you just how weak and how underloved really this is. Binance coin, continued up strength, continued up trend. Too late for me. Trends too advanced at this point. But if you're in it, keep writing it. I mean, why not? Look at the 10, maybe use the 10 day moving average or slightly, maybe one or 2% below the 10 day moving average as a stopping point. Because when this comes back down, it probably will come down fairly quickly. It'll probably do something like, I tried to indicate the other day, but it'll probably do something like that. You know, come maybe back all the way to the lower Bollinger Band. So that's something to be aware of. But while the trend is up, and if you are positioned long for a trade, then stay with the trend. This is just giving and giving and giving. So let it keep giving until it really throws you off at that point. Although taking a little bit of profit is also advised at this point. Let's have a look what else we have. EOS, I think was doing really well. Yeah, look at that. EOS continues to move higher. I was talking about maybe buying a break, sorry, a downturn or turn back towards the breakout point. Looks like we might not get that at this point. But this is looking really strong. It's still outside the Bollinger Bands. So even a touch of the 10 day moving average as it increases might be a good trade. Or even a sharp pullback, say to this, you know, 8600, 8700 area would be a good time to go along at that point. But you can see it, December low, a bit of a wedge for the February Bitcoin equivalent cycle low and now a breakout. So this is really strong. You could also go along right here, to be honest with you and be prepared for a pullback, use a much smaller position size because you're going to have quite a bit of risk in this gap and have you stop right back here at the breakout point. That's a lot of, you know, it's probably around about, let's have a look what that is. So from this point here, it's around 14%. So 14% drop in the price means that you're really going to have a fairly small size, position size for it to only have a 1% or less risk on your portfolio. But still, it's still opportunity there. That takes out a lot of the noise and lets you kind of to say, you know what, all right, I'm willing to take a little bit of a pullback in case it keeps going higher and then have, you know, a decent spot where if it gets below at this point, it's most likely going to fail and keep going lower. EOS versus the dollar, I think is even just as good, looking probably just as strong. Let's see if we can pick up something like this. It must be an old line. Yeah, something like that. That's kind of like the breakout point there. So that's looking strong as well. And again, a pullback to 320, 330 is probably a buy at this point. And then, you know, you can find a spot that you like, maybe something like that. So around about the $3 area as kind of your risk. This is looking positive. This looks like it has room now to continue higher. And this may be a $5, back to a $5 coin again at some point. So another good 30% upside potential in this one as well. Again, do your own research. I'm giving you ideas here that maybe they fit your style. All I ask is that if you do any of these and by yourself, then of course, you practice the proper risk management and put in the right position. And just make, you know, don't just go into a trade because, hey, maybe that will go up. You know, it's got to fit your style and your system. And you've got to have an objective and a target. Let's see if I can find anything else here for you before closing out for the day. Manacoin. So Manacoin sort of broke out of somewhat of a trend here, downtrend, but has really reversed again. This one is not looking good. It's not something I bought. I do own it long term. But yeah, this one has also February lows as opposed to December lows. So still a lot of weakness here overall. Don't like this much at this. Don't like this at the moment. OMG broke out, failed to do anything, came back below. That could have been somewhat of a fake out. It might go from this point. Not something I necessarily love at this point, but still has some potential here for possible move higher. Now that it's broken out, kind of retested, but it hasn't really moved with any authority. So I'm not really liking that too much. Qtum. Yeah, it's got that inverse head and shoulders capability. It's got the relative strength that we've been looking for. It's got some tight Bollinger bands. It looked like it was breaking out. I think this one looks pretty good. At this point, at the 528 Satoshi level, the lows are 500. That's not bad. That's 5% drop to new lows. This could be an entry right here. I'm not taking it right now because, again, I'm traveling. But this could be an entry at this moment. I might even make an alert out of this. I'd like to see maybe a breakout first, a push higher before doing that. But the fact that the stop is pretty tight gives me some confidence that this actually may turn out to be a good trade after all. And then Raven Coin. Look at that. That's breaking down. Excuse me. This now is in kind of no man's land, uncharted territory. Yes, you've got that bar at the low. So let's move that even lower. But yeah, that's not looking good at the moment. This here is showing new lows for the last six, five months, is it? Yeah, about five month lows. Essentially lows for since inception. So this is not very good at all. Stay away from this one. Vertcoin, I have not covered in a long time. Let me see what this looks like. Vertcoin doesn't look too bad. Big spike up here. This one has really fallen off the radar, I think, as well. I think volumes are pretty light. There was obviously that double spend attack as well that happened multiple times. So yeah, this one is probably highly manipulated as well. So I'm not seeing much here. It's already done a big spike. It's already kind of come off the bottom. So nothing I'm really loving about that one. XLM I covered earlier. And now here we go with Ripple. Okay, so here we go. I didn't notice this. I should have had an alert on this. But this looks like it's coming down now to break below the head and shoulders. And we talked about the JP Morgan coin having possible negative impact on Ripple. This is definitely not a JPM development, but it just adds or compounds to it. You know, I'm not a believer in news. But this, let's have a look here. This is starting to break down. This is probably a short at this point. But you want to see a little more possible, a little more breakdown from that neckline before getting in. I think the general rule is kind of like 1% or 2% of a breakdown before getting really excited about a short. But this is definitely a short candidate right now. So that's something I'm going to write that down. It's something I may want to take a trade on myself. XRP. All right. And then let's have a look what else we have. Zcash, which I think was acting really poorly. Yeah, Zcash. This is really negative. You can get rid of this. That didn't happen. We had the wedge down. We had a breakout. Look promising. Came all the way back, made new lows. And now we have a full body candle coming down to new lows. This is not looking good for Zcash. Nothing here but a short. And this actually is a short right here because it's making new lows as the entire sector is kind of moving higher as well. So this is definitely a short opportunity for those who want to take it or can take it. This is definitely a short possibility. It's new lows and moving pretty firmly stronger, pretty firmly lower by the looks of it. ZRX is also one that's making new lows recently. Nothing here, guys. Sorry. Maybe from a long-term perspective, if you're looking to get some long exposure, I do have long exposure to this. Not a huge amount, but it's part of my long-term portfolio. So this is maybe a value play if there is such a thing in the crypto space. But at 6,000 Satoshi, that's a pretty decent price compared to the 22,000 or 23,000 area that it was at earlier. And there is still community development and there's still actual use case for that as well. So that's a reason why I might like that. Tron. I was asked by somebody in the comments to do Tron. This looks pretty good. So this is probably the first time I'm looking at it, to be honest with you. So I'm going on the fly. But this one does have a lot of the structures that we had seen earlier. Okay. So we've kind of got a couple of shoulders, inverse. Here's the, well, actually, even more promising is that the December low that we saw everything else form, this one formed it earlier in November. So that's even probably a little more bullish as well. And then more recently, cycle low right here. So a couple of, couple of sort of shoulders, couple of, you know, one head here. Here's kind of your neckline, some resistance, broke a couple of times, came back in, starting to get some tight Bollinger bands. I think you can possibly, if you're aggressive, take a long now and use this cluster here as a stop. But I would more, I'd more like to sort of wait for a break above this area again, and then see if we can make another big move up to 4,000 or 40,000, I should say. And then from there, there's really room for it to go much higher as well. So pretty wide base here has formed coming up against this resistance. And I think if it can break above that, then you'll definitely see a significant move higher. MKR. Well, that's, that's big. That's, that's a lot of move there. This is kind of, I wouldn't call it parabolic, but certainly a big move higher, hard for me to get into moves like this. Unfortunately, if I was in earlier, maybe at kind of like this breakout point right here. So maybe above that, that would have been a chance to get in. Now at this extended level, there's just too much risk here from 15,000 down to kind of 13, eight, well, not 13,000, but 0.15, 0.16 to 0.134. That's just too much, too much gap. And the reason why there's too much gap is because of the nature of this move dictates that you can easily make significant moves lower before heading higher again as well. Just the nature of this move. So I can't get in on that. If it gets back down to these levels, and there's probably an opportunity as well. But if you are long, this is one of those cases, if you're long, and you've gone in for, you know, for various reasons, stay long, don't get out, don't panic. Now take some profit for sure. You don't want to have this all reverse and move your stops up, right? Your stops have to be all the way up and take some profit, but let it ride as well. Because this is the type of thing, if it's gone from 0.1 to 0.17, then, hey, there's no reason why it couldn't go up to 0.2 as well, right? So, you know, these type of moves always seem to surprise on the upside, but there's no reason why this couldn't sort of keep going higher, something like that before, you know, making its top as well. That's the nature of these type of parabolic structures and moves. So just stick with it if you are long, whoever that was that asked. ARK, well, these are big wicks here. Don't like big wicks. Must not have a huge amount of volume. Again, similar thing. We have a good December or November low. So we have that head and shoulders type of inverse head and shoulders structure as well. We have the breakout. Maybe a retest of the 10-day moving average. Get back in long. If you are long, whoever asked the question, stay long as well. Again, same analysis. Pull up your stops. Don't give back a lot of your gains. Move to a profit stop and take some profit on the big spikes up. I mean, hopefully, if you were long, they should took profit on these spikes. If you could, I'm not sure what the duration was in some of these, but hopefully it took some profit on these big spikes. But stay with the trend for now. It pulls back. See this pull back here? That's what I was saying before. Getting in on a move that's way above the bolognese band is very difficult. It's just chasing at that point. And I don't like chasing because you get these big swings back and I can't hold. There's no reason why I want to hold and risk so much capital and a big move back. So there's really nothing stopping something like this, making another big move back all the way to here before going higher again. And I don't want to be, if I'm already in, that's a different story, but I want to get in at these higher levels for that reason. So two different analysis there. One is, what do you do if you're not in? You don't chase. And if you are in, then you hold and you ride that wave by taking some profit and raising your stops. And then ICX. This one here is Icon. Not really familiar with it, to be perfectly honest with you. It does have new lows in February, so not showing a whole lot of strength. And not showing a whole lot of action too. Now very tight Bollinger Bands. A move could be coming, but they've been tight all along. So this one here is not the type of thing I want to, I can't even draw a trend line that makes sense. I'm not going to bother because if they don't make sense, the trend line, then don't draw them. But yeah, this is just really flat. I mean, I think eventually this may have found a bottom, but what's the point in trying to risk, why risk or why try and force a narrative on this when it doesn't really exist at this point. I think that's my entire list. Let me just quickly go through it one more time, see if I missed anything. I covered Ethereum. Oh, ABC, Bitcoin Cash. Yes, let's go back onto this because this one here is still up on the alert. Looks to be consolidating. I think this one may end up being okay. It kind of broke out of that, right? And now it is. So that's to the US dollar. Let me find it against BTC because that's what the position was. Nope. Sorry. Bear with me one second. All right. Here it is here. Okay. So still above the breakout point, forming, definitely forming a flag. So this is bullish. It still looks good to me. I have to go and check where my stop was on this and reassess. But even a slight pullback to, you know, this sort of breakout point would not be uncommon. But I think this looks good overall. I think Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin is going to do well. Again, you want to define your risk, of course, but this still looks positive to me. And then one quick last look at the list. Yeah, that's pretty much it. I just want to thank you guys again. A reminder that you always can post questions in the bottom here. This ended up being a longer video than I thought, but I'll be away for four days. So maybe that's maybe not a bad thing. Hope you enjoyed it. Hopefully the sound quality was good and have a great weekend as well. See you soon. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
