Hey, good morning Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Blukas here in New York, Monday morning, April the 8th. I hope you had a great weekend and all doing really well. This is the weekly cycles report, mostly covering Bitcoin itself. And then we'll go into some of the coins that might be moving or maybe of interest to you. So from a cycle picture, we have, I think, some positive developments that are occurring since last week's really large surge that we had. The fear was that this might have been some really big trap, right? Just a one hour type of deal and then a reversal back down and then sort of continuation lower. That has not happened. So I'm now fairly confident in sort of saying that we have a time-based cycle low in place, a short 54-day cycle following another short 53-day cycle. Both of these lows not creating any significant price damage or significant price lows. This one was fairly mild, although it was a downtrend. This was an uptrend that exploded higher with a new cycle. So we're on or in the early part of a new daily cycle or 60-day cycle. I think overall the fact that we're still holding strong and day-over-day increasing or rallying at this point and hugging the upper Bollinger Bands is really positive. This puts, with each passing day, puts this December low further sort of cemented in as being the bottom of the bear market and the bottom of the four-year cycle. Doesn't preclude, but of course, Bitcoin retracing over the next few months back down towards those levels. And maybe even in the worst case scenario, over maybe sort of five minutes or 10 minutes of extreme selling, we actually get a new price low. But that's something for later to talk about. Right now, I actually like this action a lot. I think we are going to hold this range now above this line and above the next line here on top in between here, this kind of new area now that we're out of this triangle. I think it's going to hold this area possibly for the next 60-day cycle. So what I think is going to happen mostly now, and again, we're in an area here where it's difficult to get long because we have what I believe is going to be significant resistance up here at the $6,000 level going back to the descending triangle bottom. But also, I think we have some support, but we're still kind of in the middle of that point. I think we can still kind of just move along like that, get to the point where we get up to the $5,800 level, maybe even tease and create a really nice bull trap up sort of above $6,200 very momentarily or briefly, and then come back down and then work our way down into the next 60-day cycle. That is at least what I think is the most likely scenario. But we're also, again, just not to sort of keep harping on the same thing, but we're in that point now in the bear market, in the crypto winter, breaking out of this sort of higher high area into new, into range where anything can really happen at this point. We just have to be patient with where this market might be moving over the next 60 days and find the spots that make sense from a trading standpoint. And like I said before, right now I'm sitting on my hands from a Bitcoin trading standpoint. Even though I like to go long, there just isn't the reward here in my opinion. Now, for leverage traders, there might be if I switch to, for example, a four-hour chart, and maybe be able to find some spots where I could trade long, for example. But I don't think we want to be trading that quickly and that frequently here with this type of analysis. We want to be picking our spots. So we may want to just wait now, wait, wait till we get up to this area here and see a possible short up towards the 5,800 area. Or alternatively, if we do get some type of retracement back down, maybe back towards, say, a 10-day moving average back into the high 4,000s, that could reset sentiment and reset the technical indicators to a point where I may be looking to get long again. Overall, there is no short to be had right now until the cycle develops and passes more towards a midpoint and also closer to what we believe should be a natural resistance spot, where we at least can provide a pretty tight stop just above the area here where you would think Bitcoin would not go and that resistance would reject price. But right now, just be patient here. Just be happy with the fact that we have the overall market cap going higher. We have Bitcoin in the $5,000 range, where just a month or two ago, we were in the $3,000 range. That's a nice sort of 50% bump, 40, 50% bump. We should be happy with that. And we should be happy with the fact that we are now 16 months, almost 16 months removed from the peak of the prior bull market. So that means all this extra time here is getting us closer to the next bull market and the next wave of awareness and accumulation, for example. And that's just all positive overall, right? This is what we've been waiting for patiently. So from a trading standpoint, just be patient for now until more clarity develops on the short term and just be happy with where the overall sector is moving. Flipping over to a weekly chart here showing the 60-day cycle highs and lows. So we have, I mean, this is really good, right? So we've got now a higher high for the second time and a higher, sorry, a higher low for the second time. And then we have at least the second higher high here as well with this here being sort of a double top that now has resolved to the upside. So we definitely have a new trend on the weekly scale as well. And this is very positive. We had a similar downtrend where we had lower lows and lower highs in the bear market. So now in what I believe is this crypto winter accumulation phase, we are seeing that higher, higher structure. I do believe we're going to get one shakeout at some point, whether it's this week, next week, next month, or in two months time, I can't tell you, but we're going to get a shakeout. Very few bear markets or new formed four-year cycle and bull markets very rarely avoid not providing a nice big shakeout. But until that point, this is still really encouraging. Look at the volume on this here, at least at Bitstamp, for example, highest volume since this candle back in April. Back in April, when this rallied, and I remember it clearly, people still firmly believed that this bull market trend for 2017 was intact. So we had a lot of interest still. So the fact that we have a lot of interest or just as much interest as we had back in April from a trade volume standpoint and positive trade volume, I think it's very encouraging. If you look at all the other period since then, here we go, let's get a triangle, rectangle, I should say, look at that area right there. That area here in the bear market had very little volumes. See that here. And then since then, now we've got this accumulation, the volume is just much higher at lower prices, of course. So this is all very positive. I think we get up, we test this resistance area, like I said, in a daily chart, and then we probably get some shakeout at some point. I don't know when. I've got it marked here in August. It could well come, like I said, in the May cycle low. We could get all the way back down in sort of late May, back down to sort of whatever number that is that that scares the hell out of everybody and then come back up. All those on the table. But overall, this is all very positive in a longer term cycle standpoint. I'm seeing a structure here that I like a lot. And I do firmly believe we've put that bottom in. Just give it some time here and accumulation. And that accumulation could take seven or eight months in this area. So investors will just be patient, will pick up more if they need to, if they feel they're under allocated on each dip. At this point, they would do that. And then from a trading standpoint, we're going to find our opportunities, whether they're short or long, but now just be mindful. And I'm going to flip back to a daily chart here on the daily chart. Be mindful now that if we're going to short, we need a better setup than before. In this environment here in the bear market, I was shorting early on. I was more confident in my shorts because I knew we were in a bear market. Now, I don't believe we're in a bear market. So my shorting needs to be very calculated and at very opportune times where the risk reward is good, where the cycle count is more advanced, where there's a logical tight stop, and where there's a good opportunity to go lower. So what I'm more mindful of now is that if we're in a new kind of accumulation phase or bull market, that I could get longer more often with not so many ideal situations, or not as ideal situations, because we have a bull trend behind us. So that can forgive a lot of entry and timing issues that we may have. So I also want to not be taking profit as quickly and as early as I did here when I was going long. Before when I was going long in this early cycles, I was taking profit sharply and quickly because I knew the market could reverse at any given time and rapidly and take me out. So I wanted to bank my profit quickly. Right now, each time I get long going forward, I'm going to be holding that position for longer because I want the market and the bull trend to reward me for getting in. Okay, let's take a look at Ethereum real quick. I think Ethereum has languished and not done too much. But I think it could be ready to go. It's one of those assets that always gets a run at some point and it hasn't yet. And I think this is sort of waiting in the wings here to make its move. So just keep an eye on this. I think I'm going to have an alert set for just sort of above this area here. Against the dollar, excuse me, it's made a nice move already. And so it's definitely moving higher. I like this one here. I would also be long this one here from a dollar standpoint. This looks like it could be breaking out. And we know Ethereum, once it makes a move higher, you've got 200s, 300s, all above. And if you look at Litecoin as an example, it went from 400 down to 20. And now it's back up to sort of $90. Ethereum was at what's that? $1,600 down to $70. So I'll move back to $200 and $300 similar to Litecoin is probably not out of the question here. So I'm just keeping an eye on this one here. I like Ethereum versus the dollar. I may be looking at that from a future standpoint, but also Ethereum versus Bitcoin, I think has a chance to break out as well. All right, just posted an alert very recently, a Tron versus the dollar, not versus Bitcoin versus the dollar, because I had this chart mapped. And I heard I had my alert set. So I've taken a long here. Short would be just below this candle here. If you zoom in. Okay, right below kind of this blue area here. All right, give it some room to come back. But I like the way this is breaking out. Got a very nice base here to work with. Kind of like a head in the middle here, a couple of shoulders on either end seems to be coming up and looks pretty strong at the moment. I think something similar on Tron versus BTC could be had as well. The chart doesn't look as nice. Of course, I liked it versus the dollar. But yesterday's candle as well could be used as a stop. But I do like how clear the Tron dollar chart is. So that's what I've taken based on the chart alone. I'm also still long XMR BTC not doing a whole lot here. I'm starting to think that this is not going to move. Still have my stop below. Just paying attention on this one for the time being. And just, you know, let's give it some room. And then if it doesn't do much at some point over the next few days, probably by Friday's lining report, I'd probably cut the position and just let it go. All right. So that's the wrap up for the cycles update on the daily chart and the weekly chart. Overall, very encouraging, very positive. I think we have a lot to be excited about. I think we have a lot to look forward to in 2019. I think if we keep our head, find the right positions, the right trades, and also stay fully invested across the board, it's going to end up being a very rewarding period for all of us to stay the course and just focus on, you know, on what we're on, what's developing here in Bitcoin and across the crypto space as well, all positive and all very good developments. All the best to you. Leave some questions for me and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
