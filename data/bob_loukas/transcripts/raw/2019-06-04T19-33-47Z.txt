Hey Bitcoin Live members. Bob Lucas had a little bit of free time here this afternoon. thought I'd record a very quick video update on what we're seeing here in BTC. obviously a pretty significant drop here- over over a thousand dollars in the last kind of 24 hours, looking at 1800 or so off the very top, getting to around about a 16- I think it is percent decline from the from the highest. take a look: yeah, we're looking at around about 17- 18 percent- pretty sizable at the moment. so only one of two things could be going on here that explains this. one is that the interpretation of the cycle is is that we still have this long cycle from March 25th in play. this is one cycle. this candle here was a drop, come back up and this is the top of the cycle. now we're finishing off the cycle. this holds a decent amount of credibility in my opinion, because we don't have a very clean cut cycle low. if we- if originally I marked this area here as the cycle low, that would have made some sense, I think, if we ran on to make some some pretty big highs from there. but the way this is broken down and below a 20-day moving average gives me the idea that we are still looking for the cycle low. so if that's the case, it's still. it's still a good thing, because a 20 percent or correction after a move like this is really nothing, and you can see on the chart if you, if you look at where it started at 3800 to where it is now, that's still nothing of a correction. so so these are two, two alternative scenarios that I see. one is we got a little more downside to go, maybe over the next 48 hours, down to maybe the 7200 dollar level, which is around the bottom of the Bollinger Bands and also lines up with these two pretty significant um candles here. one was the end of the move- you can forget the wick, especially on Bitstamp, but from a closing price standpoint, end of this decline and then boom, we had a pretty big rally up. so there's some significance to these two points here. kind of get a double bottom off that and then rally back up, start the new cycle and go off to new highs again. that um, that is kind of a max pain situation, because all the bulls now with this breakdown are pretty much out, at least all the traders are pretty much out and they're starting to look short now, um, too late. of course, short should have come at the eight thousand dollar break, but they're looking short and they'll start to add more and more shorts here and that will feel the next kind of rally, if we get this cycle low, occur as we. um, as I have it marked right there, that's scenario number one. so that's a good 23 percent pullback. 60 day cycle low forms around about day 70- I have to count it out again- and then we rally up and make new highs. few people would be able to get and buy this dip and come back up and then before you know it, it would probably be back at around 8500 and then people start to buy as well. second scenario is is one where we still have the cycle top up here and that we're looking at more of a correction and an end. let me zoom out to this really big one: two, three cycle move higher, which is 180 off the lows. if that's the case, then we do need- let me stop that, that's incorrect. we do need to then mark the cycles something like this: okay, because then that either there or there, that gives us, uh, this left translated cycle, which is what we need for a major correction if you want to spend a couple of months, or close to a couple of months, consolidating these gains and pulling back 30 to 40 percent, you would need the cycle to be marked here. then what would happen is we would get another high here. so you have a day one, two, three, four, kind of like a day 12 high, which is a left translated cycle, something you see, or you we did see, in kind of the bear market decline, even though they weren't that left translated, had day 19 there. so that would be one situation. and then let's draw in kind of what you would see potentially, of course, um. so you'd see a decline, you would see a bounce back, but you'd see more of a um, you know, more of a consolidation, i guess, or more of a grind. and then i'm not sure what the floor would be. 6400 seems logical to me. that's kind of the breakdown point from here. but going below that for a little bit of time as well would not be all that surprising. so that's, that's a pretty big correction there. that would be um. actually i probably didn't draw that too well because it's only june. um, we're looking for kind of like a mid-august or late, early august, i should say cycle low. in that case, let's just try and redraw this a little bit better for you, so we'll get, you know, maybe a bounce back up, come down half cycle low, come back up, maybe back up to here, and then sort of begin the really fast portion of the decline. let's just say, argument's sake, 6200, and then we can either go on to make new highs or we can chop and maybe retest the highs again and then spend one more cycle sort of going sideways. at that point, many ways it can go. you know, i originally, originally i thought out of the four year cycle low that it wouldn't, you know, it wouldn't, it wouldn't really get going until kind of november or december in a few cycles. so the fact that we've already, you know, up 180 in in in these first three cycles is pretty much, i think, all we should expect, even though you know, of course, getting back above the 10 000 so soon would not also surprise me. but really we shouldn't expect too much and we should be, we should be at least prepared, at least mindful of the fact that bitcoin needs to console there, and we should, we should want it to consolidate more, because this type, these types of moves are really not sustainable in a longer trend or longer time period. we want more of a base. i'm hoping here that this is kind of a recognition event where there was just too much demand, too much, too many institutional buyers buying very large sums of bitcoin. that has pushed up the price significantly, of course, and then this last portion here to above the above the 5500- was more of a speculative move and i think this portion is going to be retraced at some point. so even if we draw a line from this cluster here out- you know that's kind of the 5600- that to me is kind of the floor in price in any type of decline. but that's what i'd be looking for. so a couple different scenarios there. i you know, obviously, the fact that we've kind of lost the 20-day moving average- 10 days really turning and the 20s moving. i think we're now in for either, like i said, the 60-day cycle low or the correction that probably plays out over a longer period of time for the remainder of the uh the cycle again. um, any rally from here to go up to new highs is a cycle low right here, and then we've got potentially another 40 or 50 days of a rally and this rally that has been in place since february would still be in place. it would not be negated by any of this. the only time it would be negated, i think, would be a drop below the 7200 area where these two candles are, because that's where i'd mark the cycle low, and if we get below that level, then it's more of a correction playing out as opposed to a cycle low. we really should hold, i think, this level in a in a decline. so that's the analysis. i wanted to do that really quickly. i'll still come out with a top 10 report tomorrow, but i just thought i'd get something up on the site for today. all the best.
