Good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas Friday morning in New York. Hope you're doing really well and looking forward to your weekend. I'm feeling a little under the weather this morning so my voice is probably going to be coming in and out somewhat. But today is the lightning report. I'm going to cover over 30 coins. The list seems to be getting longer each week, so these reports are taking longer and longer Again. the disclaimer here is that my primary focus is in Bitcoin and the Bitcoin cycles. The altcoins are for trading when I see a favorable setup, Something that looks like could move higher or has a nice trend to it. I want to point that out Again. the other disclaimer is that a lot of these I'm looking at for the first time, or I'm looking at them for the first time in a week since the last report. So you know, like anything in trading, it's best to be more familiar with the way a particular asset or coin trades. Normally, each sort of asset has its own little flavor in how it sort of moves and oscillates on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis, So I'm not privy to a lot of that information. I'm looking at a lot of these charts purely in sort of a very fresh look and giving an opinion very rapidly on that, And for that point you really got to take what I say with a grain of salt and use it more just to complement whatever research or whatever you're looking at and seeing, and maybe if it kind of gels with what you're seeing or if it fits with your strategy, then maybe that helps. But otherwise I don't encourage anybody so just jumping all over something that I particularly say. Now, if there's something I really like from a trade standpoint, I'm going to trade it myself and I'm going to make an alert in that case. That's when you know I'm, at least as far as I'm personally concerned, vested and taking on my own risk. So maybe that those types of situations you can take maybe a little more seriously, Okay, so that being said, of course we'll start off with Bitcoin, as we always do, and you know at the moment we're seeing a little bit of a pullback: two, three day pullback. I think this is very healthy and very normal. We obviously had a big surge coming out of the- you know, the wedge or triangle pattern here. Overall, the trend is up. The trend is up on the daily chart. We have at least at least one full cycle high that is higher than the well, actually even to the last one, but we have at least one cycle low that is higher than the other one. But I think we have two cycle lows that are higher than the prior ones. So we definitely have a step up on the lows and we have at least one cycle high somewhere. wherever this ends up being, whether it's here or whether it's further out, it's going to be at least one cycle higher, higher than the other two. So that's just the definition of a trend, an uptrend. It may not be a solid uptrend, but regardless, the fact is, December is the last major low, So we have to respect the fact that we're released in. we're at least in some type of uptrend, and we're seeing the same in the altcoin space. We are seeing many of the charts show us. some have already broken out, of course, and doing really well, like Litecoin and others, but the rest of them seem to have rounded bottoms and are showing uptrends at the moment. So we need to shift our bias somewhat to be a little more bullish. I'm not saying we should not be uber bullish at this point. We are still in this sideways chopping market as far as I'm concerned. but we're not in the savage bear market either where we want to be very hesitant to take trades or to be taking profit very rapidly. So just always- I like to point that out in the beginning because when I approach my trading and approach my chart analysis, I like to think of what the, the overall trend is telling me and that kind of sets a little bit of my bias or sets my thinking and how accommodating I want to be when it comes to some of the analysis or some of the setups that I may be looking at. So for Bitcoin, again pulled back back to the 10-day moving average, slightly below that. Overall, I like this chart. Can it go lower? I think it can go down to the 20-day moving average. I think if it gets down, to say, to this sort of point, that's probably even- you know, maybe- a healthy buy at this point and then we can maybe make another move up and possibly test that 5800 level area later in the cycle, later in the month. and if we can get a test up in that area later in the month, what it does is at least puts us at a point where we're topping in the cycle later on. I mean, we had some early tops, even though the cycles were short. These are both left translated but with higher lows, So a mixed bag. overall. It seems like we have a lot of selling pressure along with a lot of buying support here, creating this sort of crunch that we see in the Bollinger Bands and crunch in the sort of triangle pattern. That's just the nature of people selling in to lower prices, thinking I think it's going to go lower, and also the accumulation that we're seeing from the sidelines in Bitcoin. So we're seeing a lot of that. This now has escaped higher, I think, and I want to see- I want to see the cycle form a top- hopefully late April, even into May would be nice- maybe form right translated and stay in this sort of zone here, above the prior two highs that we have for cycle highs and uh below the 6800- 5800 level. I think that sets up the scene for more accumulation and more of this uptrend and then, you know, later by the summer maybe looking at sort of breaking out of that zone and coming up higher. And you see something similar on the weekly chart. here's the, here's the weekly good volume coming in more recently: uh, seven straight weeks of green candle. so it's not unlikely or unusual to see a red candle come in, maybe even two. we may inform, uh, sort of a three week consolidation, um, you know, sort of like a a flag here, um, on the weekly chart as well, that's possible. I mean, you know, we have to wait a few more weeks, of course, but something like that before moving higher and that puts us in, that that can create the right translated cycle that we, that we want to see at this point. we haven't seen a right translated cycle in many, many cycles. but right here, filling in this gap. see, there's very little fill in here, it's just this one big bar coming down and then, most of the all, the action is below, you know, below this 4200 area. so filling in this gap here for maybe one or two cycles would be ideal before taking a few cracks at this heavy resistance area. that will, I think, will provide a lot of resistance for most of the year. okay, so that's the bitcoin analysis. from a trade standpoint, I don't see anything right now, um, because it's not such a clean setup, but you know, you've got a couple of candles down here around the 4700 area. if we get a little further down, we may be able to consider taking some type of a long trade and then using maybe those candles or something like that. it's not very clean, but I do like to pull back. I mean I don't want to short any of this. it's too early in the cycle and this looks like just a controlled pullback and consolidation here and nothing more sinister than that on the four hour chart. you know, you kind of see it rolling over here. if we can kind of roll back down into this sort of 47- 4800 area, uh, maybe an opportunity, but for now I mean, I'm sure traders can find an opportunity here, but for me I'm just going to sit the sidelines, wait it out and look for something more obvious before wanting to get long. what I do like, and I'm going to switch over to ethereum right now. so ethereum dollar is still a position I hold. um, I still like this chart here. it's got to be honest with you, even though it's sort of come back. we had a little bit of a breakout. it's come back. it's retested and dropped slightly below the breakout point, back below the 10 day moving average, which I don't like, but still above the 20.. so if as long as it stays above the 20 um and and that 20 right now is at um. what is it? it's at 150. actually it's 156, which is where my stop is as well. so, um, right here is where my stop- 156.. so I still like this position here. I can hopefully see it rally back up now that's that sort of retest and spend some time here. so this is what I see on ethereum versus the dollar still position that I hold. if you didn't get in, it still offers a decent uh risk reward here I think the reward is potential is, uh, all the way up sort of in the in a 230- 240 range um, and then the risk, of course, at the moment is around about 10 dollars uh for each ethereum down to 156. so it's a decent opportunity. the chart still looks good as far as I'm concerned. ethereum btc is holding up, hasn't done anything, but it hasn't dropped either. um, looking like nice sort of bottoming pattern as well. so this one has the opportunity to break higher. hasn't made any real moves, so nothing I like significantly on this chart. but um, you know like I like the ethereum versus dollar more than anything else. uh, just playing around with some something. yeah, I would need a break sort of higher this area to kind of kind of convince me that we have a bottom in here, bottom in play and then a move higher. so I'm sticking more with ethereum versus the dollar. all right, now let's get into the main list of coins. now let me be clear on something. a lot of these coins, uh, have a decent reversal or decent sell-off over the last week, so there's been a good sell-off. the ones that did not show breakouts and positive uptrends did not look good. I'm going to skip over. I'm going to cover them, but just going to the analysis is going to be very brief. don't want to be, I don't want to be in a coin or trading something that didn't break out, that didn't have relative strength, that's not showing me a nice chart pattern- like ada is right here, because I want to buy pullbacks for coins that are in an uptrend. I don't want to be buying stuff that didn't break out, the only forms that seem to be forming around the bottom but it's since not broken out and actually come back near the lows. there's quite a few of those types of charts and those are the ones you want to avoid. I know there's a tendency for people to think, oh, there's value there that hasn't made a move yet. if I just buy it, it's going to make a move. no, that's a trap. yeah, some of them may make moves, but a lot of them may easily make new lows as well. I think you want to be buying the strength. you want to be buying the charts, like this one here that looks good. that is showing us a pullback. so this one here looks really good. um, I mean, I'm long this one. still, I'm holding this long the initial pattern I drew back in March, over a month ago. it's pretty much playing out. we have a nice pullback right here. I think this is a buy you could use, if you know. if you want to trade this, you could. I think you can use a couple of these wicks here as your stop. so around about the 1500 level, 1500 satoshi- this looks like it's pulled back. if it's going to continue the uptrend, then this might be the extent of the sell-off. so ADA to me looks really good. I'm holding my last position for at least this 2400 area, but maybe even this sort of 3000 area is my target on that. so ARK fits in the middle of those two uptrend versus hasn't broken out type of coins I mentioned. this one does have a breakout, but not a solid uptrend, and we do have a good pullback all the way, kind of to. I wouldn't really call it a neckline, but at least this line here where we did see a few of the tops before breaking out. so overall this isn't a bad chart. this is a good pullback, I think. if it consists, if the whole altcoin space could find a low right at this point, this one has some good potential. so if you've been following, this one has potential as well. definitely, back to this point is is positive and we could could rally up from here. air swap is a horrible looking chart. it has exactly what I said before: around the bottom without breaking higher, and now it's breaking lower. so this one for me is definitely an avoid. okay, bat is one of one chart that I actually like more from a long-term standpoint. this one broke out last week just going to sort of put something here, not exactly perfectly touching, but you can see. you know repeated attempts in this area and then another one right here and then a good solid move and now back down. so I don't know anything about the tech, but if you like the tech, this is a good looking chart. in my opinion it's almost like kind of like a wedge as well, so you've got to go that. I think this looks good. it's broken out, come back retested. this is a good entry here for the long-term play. not sure from a trade standpoint what I see here, if I don't see, if I see anything but this one I like from a long term. this is a very pretty looking chart, long term wise. Bitcoin Cash: ABC: nice move up, another move up, consolidating, I think, as long as it's above the 20-day moving average here. this is a good looking chart and stick with the trend. you can buy this area here. maybe use these two stops, these two wicks, the bottoms of the lows of these, as your stop point. but this does look like good chart. it seems like it's at least in an uptrend. um, and yeah, this is, uh, this is a probably a bit of buy right now. if you're holding, if you bought this and you're holding, definitely stay, stay with it, stick with it. and then somebody asked about um in in the comments section about Bitcoin Cash versus the dollar. similar looking chart here, actually maybe a little, a little prettier as well, because we had this good move above the Bollinger Bands. now it's coming back again. stay long on this one. this one does look good. um, I think your exit is probably below the 20 and on a closing basis or something like that, but, um, you know it's had a double already, so that's you know. so you definitely be taking some profit if you got in sort of in this area down here. don't want to be, uh, riding your entire move here. take some profits already doubled, but this one has potential to maybe even get up to sort of the 350 400 range fairly easily and even more, because it does have a lot of room higher, uh, at least up to like the 490 500 area. and I think also this is probably catching a bit because bitcoin sv has not been doing well. it's, it's negative in the news and, and being that that was a fork and bitcoin abc exists because of that fork, then it's very likely that some of the value is getting transferred over as well. yeah, sv, as I said last week, looks horrible. don't like anything about this chart. hasn't done anything. I would have thought it would have had some type of rally with bitcoin abc or bitcoin cash. it has not and, like I said earlier. again, there's a lot of negative press around craig wright and sort of the whole organization in general, so this does not look positive. I would avoid this finance coin to me now looks like I'm out topped. we have a cross of the 10 with the 20 day moving average, so that's the first sign we are touching the lower bollinger bands, not just once, but twice. I don't. I don't mind a touch the lower bollinger bands in an uptrend. that's generally a good buying signal. but this is done in a couple times now and now seems to be hugging the bottom bollinger bands, which means it's now trending that way as opposed to just being over oversold. so for me this now is a sell or avoid. if you rode most of this, I think it's time to start seriously considering taking a lot of the profit, keeping some if you like it from a long-term standpoint. but it's had a major run and people made a lot of money in this. so I think you've got to be cautious here that if profit taking release begins, then it could get much worse. and then also you can look at kind of this low here exceeded that low here. you would have thought that bounce off that area. so to me it looks like now we have the makings of a new trend lower. so just be cautious and be be aware of that if you're in binance coin. bit shares kind of had a breakout, although it's a. you know I don't trust bigger weeks like this on on lightly traded coins, but I wouldn't call this a nice uptrend. yet this is kind of a rounded bottom and I don't like the fact that we really pierced the lower bollinger band here. I think we could be trending lower again. this one, um, doesn't look like a nice pullback in an uptrend as far as I'm concerned. it just looks too severe for me, so I would avoid this one. exactly the same type of thing on civic coin that we have on bit shares. exactly the same analysis: just too much of a downtrend, too much of a pullback, even more so for civic coin. so this one for me, is not a good looking chart. I would definitely avoid this. dash, on the other hand, is in an uptrend. it has this step up, step up, step up. so I think why, as long as this prior low holds, it is an opportunity to possibly get long again. you, if you get long for a trade, the the uptrend is still in play. we do have a clear higher highs and higher low structure here. this pullback is significant and healthy. so if you want to get long for the intermediate sort of time frame, you could, I think, and then definitely use this as your stop. at the moment, which isn't too far lower, I think this could continue the structure. if, certainly if all coins are going to get another bid in the next sort of few days or week, then this one looks like it certainly would participate and kind of make that move higher again and make another higher high before coming back down and forming another lower. so this one is one of those coins I mentioned earlier where it's an uptrend and this is a pullback. so at least have you have some type of opportunity to get long in case the market does go higher. somebody asked for decreed and that makes sense. this is a, you know, one of one of the top 30- I guess it is coins, but nothing, I nothing much on this. it definitely has the makings of around the bottom, but we do have new lows in March. I don't like that and this was not exactly an uptrend or a rally. I mean, we did have some big spikes, but don't trust wicks like that again, um, meaningless to a large extent. so the bulk of these candles seem like it kind of came over bottom but could easily continue rolling lower. there isn't a trend for me to be to support myself on this one, so that's why I don't want to be part of this. for a trade, even intermediate term doesn't seem like it has broken out at all or formed any type of new trend. so for me this is an avoid ENJ. so this one had a nice trend, but I think this is not really more. this is more of a- uh, what do you want to call it? not a parabolic surge, but certainly it's sort of a game-changing surge. so this this doesn't classify as a trend. this is more of just, uh, an awakening to some extent. so I've talked about this one for a while. since it kind of lost its upward structure, like I've talked about with Binance, it's now just trended lower. so I think we want to get back down to this cluster. it's not until we get down here that I would be looking maybe for another sort of long trade. so it's got a little more work to go, I believe, a lot of profit taking still going on, and now it's just lost its allure and people have moved on to something else. so you know you always want to be trading the one, especially in the altcoin space. you want to be trading early the ones and the coins that people are talking about and really jumping on, because it is a very speculative market and and the crowd moves from one coin to the next to the next fairly rapidly and this one is now just not something that's in focus. so just be aware of that. EOS actually is a beautiful looking chart. we have big bottom December lows. it's pulled out and didn't actually sell off that much at all. actually, it's actually shown a lot of relative strength against Bitcoin. so this is one you want to be buying. you want to be long for the long term. I think it has a lot of potential long term from a trade standpoint as well. you can be going long here because it's just holding up really well. so this one is maybe- or at least so far from the ones I've reviewed- the best looking of them all. ETC had a breakout last week. come back, I wouldn't classify this as an uptrend, so I don't want to be buying a dip. I don't really see much I like here, to be honest with you, I don't like the technology either. I don't see why Ethereum Classic is even around. that maybe is influencing my- my short-term view here. but yeah, I mean makings of around and bottom- December lows again, but- and maybe a pull back to the 10- 20 moving day moving average. so it's not too bad, but I don't see a good trade here. there's just other ones that I like much more. Gold Chain was starting to look really promising, but it's come all the way back here. I don't like buying bottoms for trying to pick lows. I mean, I I kind of find that that doesn't work too often, but this has a couple of lows already. so it's possible. if you like this, this could be a good long term entry. if you kind of want to hold this for a long term. if you might love the technology. I don't know enough about it, but certainly you don't want to be taking a position and then um, letting it go below these two lows that we have, one back in October and one back in February. so be aware of that. you could could play the triple kind of bottom aspect to this, but yeah, not enough relative strength. typically, if something's near a bottom, it's there for a reason it's not positive. you're just, you're just trying to guess at a low and get in early, but in the long run I'm not sure if they give you the best odds. Grin continues to make new lows. um, this is just a horrible looking chart, sorry, it's just red everywhere and making lower lows consistently. I think this is going to take some more time to stabilize and find kind of a bottom. it is only still a new project, a new coin, so just be patient with this one. I don't see a trade. I don't see anything from a long term standpoint either. ICX was one of those coins that I was looking at recently for a pullback, you know, because it does have a little bit of an uptrend, a little concern that maybe it's come back too much. if it can break back above this sort of level here, then it could be a buy we're using kind of. you know, maybe the full body of the candles stop, I'm not sure. but overall, um, it needs more work. not enough of an uptrend for me to get excited about the pullback. so just this is: watch on the watch list for now. see what it can do. even just being patient on this one, waiting for it to come back above this line or even the the recent highs and moving, moving my alert- maybe back to recent highs. wait for it to re-establish an uptrend before wanting to get long again on this one self key. um, no, very bad. um, this is obviously- again- I think I say this every week- probably some type of altcoin- uh, sorry, let's talk about like micro cap, um coin, but new lows avoid. get out. if you're in this, get your money and run. link showed a very nice uptrend from back in July, which is probably the best looking up trend that we have, even better than light coin. so beautiful looking chart. we can excuse, then, the the really significant drop here. um, if, if the altcoin space is moving higher, I think this will recover. it's just as a beautiful uptrend overall, um, so this is a good opportunity to get long if you'd like the project. from a long-term standpoint, this is offering you a good 40 discount from the recent highs and an opportunity to get back in on a trend. from a trade standpoint, I want to see this recover and maybe get back up into this area before looking to get long. lisk, on the other hand, is in a consistent downtrend. this is not even this is not a good looking chart from a short or long-term standpoint as well. um, started to- maybe you know, to get back up and try and form a trend higher and uptrend, but never really did. never really took off significantly enough, in my opinion, to warrant buying. the pullback ltc is a perfect example of an uptrend and this being a pullback- nice big pullback here- uh, significant- stopped out quite a few people. I think you can go long again now and kind of use the bottom of the wick here and, you know, give it a little more cushion as your stop. um, although you may want to first see the signs of a recovery. uh, of course, the further you let it get away from you, the the more the the gap becomes between your entry and your risk. so your smaller position should be. so you may want to give this an opportunity to get back above at least sort of the, the high of the candle that represents the low. so yesterday's candle is the low, using the high. so around about this uh 16 600 level, getting back above that can trigger a buy, which is also a move back above the 10-day moving average, and then you can use kind of the low of yesterday's candle as your stop. keep an eye on this one. this one is a um. one of the types of this is the type of trend you want to be buying in in this type of market and at least you know that if all coins continue higher, then this is most likely going to continue this trend up. mana coin: yeah nothing. nothing i really like here and this is just sideways chopping for pretty much the entire year. and if you can pull back all the way down to the bottom here, it's a good entry for a long-term play. but from a trade standpoint, there's nothing here that interests me at all. mkr did have a nice uptrend. um didn't roll over, like many things i expected, and i think i talked about buying a pullback to kind of this breakout point. it's down below that, so that concerns me, and we do have quite a bit of hugging of the bollinger band here. so this was bullish to me as a pullback buy potential during the week, but now it seems to exceeded that, so i don't like that as well. so i'm just gonna have to just wait and see. on this one, nano was a new request in the in the comment section this week. um, this one actually isn't bad because, yes, it only it doesn't have an uptrend, but it has a rounded bottom. the last low was back in august and it didn't pull back that much. so you know, like i said before, ones that pulled back without an uptrend i'm not interested in, but this one didn't pull back at all and it's forming that that kind of bottom here as well. um, so i like this one here. this is something you can get long. if you love the tech, you definitely. yeah, this chart looks pretty good to me, um, and also it has a trade up trade potential. now, if it's going to make new recent highs and new sort of six month highs, this is an opportunity to get long. maybe use one of these candles below here as your stop. so this is a good looking chart. thanks for pointing that out in the comment section. now, omg was looking really good, had a nice uptrend in play- higher high, higher high, higher lows- but now we have a breakdown, so i don't like this. i think if, if this move down held these lows here, then that would have been positive. but we have quite a bit of separation now between the 10 and 20 day moving average and where price is today and of course we have that cross. so, uh, i think i want to avoid this one at the moment. this one has the potential to go lower. ont is not broken. it has a nice pullback and a nice uptrend, again more more of a pullback than i would have liked. um, so from a trade standpoint, i'm not sure if i want to be buying it yet until it can move higher. maybe back above the 10 day moving average would get me interested again in this one. overall, the charts not too bad, similar to a lot of the breakdowns that we see, but nothing, nothing horrendous yet to the point where the charts busted, but it is getting close to that. it's going to want to reverse pretty soon to keep this trend looking healthy and looking positive. yeah, cutom is breaking down here. um, another reason why i didn't really want to get into this one. it's now broken kind of below this cluster here, which was kind of a breakout point. you know i'm kind of mixed feelings about this one. i do think it has a lot of long-term potential. i think if you, if you like this one, you want to be buying in this area. this is a good, nice, wide bottom here, ignoring this ridiculous work here on binance, but you know we do have a lot of lows in this zone here. you know maybe we'll get another one soon over here, um. so from a long-term standpoint- i like from a short-term standpoint- i think you want to wait for this to re-establish an upturn and get above the the recent highs that it made before looking to trigger another long trade. rlc continues a nice uptrend, didn't really break down and continues higher. so this one here: if you went long, stay long. there is a trade opportunity here as well. if you can find the right setup that suits your style. i do like this chart and i think it looks positive. if you like the technology- i don't know anything about it- then this is still a good looking chart in my opinion. all right, the good old raven- um, pretty good. nice pullback, um, healthy pullback, nothing crazy. it had a major move and has really held fairly well. i think this one could be a candidate for getting long again and looking maybe another new sustained uptrend. i think we would be wrong, though, if it kind of moved back below these two lines here. um, that would definitely negate, i think, the trend at that point. so this one here was over a week ago came back to test it. so if that trend continues low and breaks below this line, then i think you have a bit of a problem, uh, in the short term, although it could be moving all the way back to the original breakout point to be able to establish a new longer term trend. so in the short term, this is a potential to swing. you want to see it come back, swing and, you know, get back above the 10 and 20 day moving average before maybe getting long, um, and then otherwise. look at this zone here, which i think i highlighted last week as potentially where it's coming back to for more of an intermediate term structure or uptrend, coming off this and, you know, going higher for the rest of uh or most of 2019.. strat shows me nothing to get excited about. the only thing that's interesting is that there's a huge sort of base here, but until it gets above that line, there is nothing to be had here, because this is near the lows and could easily break down further. so avoid this one. resist any temptation to sort of buy, buy a bottom, because it has more of a more, more of a chance to break it. lower than it does, higher than it does, higher than it does, higher than it does, higher than it does, higher than it does, higher than the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and the lows and
