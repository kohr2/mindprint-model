Hello Fintac members, it's Bob Lucas. It is around 3 p.m. Eastern time in New York, April the 10th. I hope you're doing well. This is your midweek update. Looking at gold first and well, another surprising move. A lot of strength here. Just don't not see why it has not broken down. A lot of support in this area here where we obviously expected the ICO decline to by this point have taken a firm hold on this market. Now the trend in the short term is still lower. We do have sort of a lower high here. The lows are holding up. They're holding up at the moment, creating some support here. So the question really becomes now what is this move all about? We certainly have a day 20 daily cycle low in play now. This has been marked. This is confirmed. We have four pretty strong days higher, back above the 10 and 20 day moving average. Just do not see how we are on sort of day 36 of a cycle that began back in March. So this is definitely another daily cycle. What's confusing about all this is that we have so many daily cycles now without anything remotely close to an investor cycle low. So we've got one, two, three, four, five, six, and this would be the seventh. I have never seen any cycles, any weekly cycles that have seven daily cycles going back over 20 years of cycle history or cycle data that I've that have collected. So I mean, it's always a first for everything, but from a week standpoint as well, we're already sort of into week 35, 36. So it's getting, getting kind of ridiculous here. I'm not too sure what to make of this, except for maybe the fact that we've just got a whole lot of buying support in this area. The market does not want to move lower. Um, and it's just, just holding up here. Well, right below zooming out here, kind of right below that continuous resistance area at around about 1360, where I think everybody is now really focusing on. So I, I, I, I, I can only interpret from, from this type of action and not seeing kind of a weekly cycle load down in this sort of low 1200 area that we may be consolidating here via time, putting in sort of a time-based ICL, maybe one more touch of of this downtrend line, come back, hit some support again. That's more than enough time in this period here for possibly shooting up higher. And then looking back in a month or two and saying, oh, wow, this was just some significant consolidation over time, not allowing gold and the market to really move lower. And that was the ICL of that, um, is something that I think we are going to be looking at when we, when we look back on gold in a few months. Um, of course that would all be negated if we do, in fact, you know, have, have that final push lower. I mean, I, I, I, I've been talking about it for so long. I, I'm almost so hesitant to say that it's due. It is due. Um, we do need to see ideally price lows to complete the cycle, but you know, I thought this one was going to do that. Then I thought this low, then I thought this cycle low, um, becomes a point where it's just becomes tiring to continuously call out daily cycle lows. Um, so something's going on here. Of course, I really can't explain it to, to that much detail. We need to let this play out, let it evolve over some time. And let's see if we do maybe get this time-based consolidation, form a final, um, kind of cycle low daily cycle low here that would mark kind of the end point of this consolidation zone. And then let's see if we can rock it higher from that point. And this is what I'm talking about on the weekly chart on the weekly chart. We're back now, right above the 10 week moving average, which we do see in a downtrend, uh, occasionally if it is just a sort of a wick above that, and then it closes below that point. So when you zoom out to the weekly, it's still not clear that we are just consolidating like I sort of, uh, theory, you know, the theory I have here, um, it could still well be just one of these very long process, um, type cycles where now we're hitting up against a 10 week moving average, and then it's just going to move lower from that point. Um, I don't know, maybe, maybe we just don't see a clear cut sort of week 24, 25 cycle low. Maybe we go all the way to kind of week 50 here. Maybe this becomes a long drawn out cycle and process from this point where I'm just going to draw something in kind of, kind of crudely here. All right. And we kind of just have this deeper cycle and then we move higher again. So, you know, when looking back at it, we'll have, um, almost like a week sort of 50, a week 40, week 50 cycle, but really it'd be two cycles in one where we just don't have a clear cut mid cycle point. Um, that would be my other explanation for what could be going on here. We did have something very long here as well. That was only 34 weeks. We're already at that point now. Um, again, ideally the cleanest path here is that whatever strength we're seeing right now gets reversed. It doesn't feel like it on the tape, to be honest with you, on the tape, it feels kind of, kind of strong. Uh, but ideally we just get this and we finish this off, um, by kind of like late May. And then we get on with making an attempt to get back above that 1360 level. Uh, ideally that's what I still want to see. Um, but it's just hard to tell. There's just no clear cut evidence, but at the moment it's obvious that we have a top and it's obvious that we're going to decline 10 weeks moving lower. So at some point, you know, we still have to acknowledge and realize that I think we still are on that declining phase. The question is, is it just going to consolidate via time before going up in a new cycle or is it going to give us finally this type of green line, uh, that we've been looking for? So that still, to me, I have to just based on history and based on how most cycles move, I still have to favor this type of idea. But again, just reiterating what I sort of pointed out on the daily cycle chart, we could still see kind of, you know, this chop and then that would be really bullish at that point. And then we're going to kind of have like a triangle sort of thing here. Um, you know, and then a continuation higher two alternatives there at the moment. I don't really don't see any, um, any need to be short at the moment. It's just too much strength. I got out of my short on this reversal. Don't do not see any need to be long unless we at least break going back to the daily kind of break above this trend line here, but also more importantly, break above the day 12 high. If we break above this and the whole, there's no way this line should give away if we're in an ICL decline, that's just too far up. Um, and it's obviously a very clear cut daily cycle high. So getting above that at this point is a trend changer. And then I would look, be looking for some surprise moves higher than trying to get long as soon as possible on that type of move. SMP still looks great. I mean, the chart is beautiful. It's been riding the upper Bollinger bands for the majority of the time, except for the daily cycle low, uh, still plenty of time in the cycle to make a push even enough time, ideally or theoretically to, to make a push to new all time highs. We're not that far at the moment, but we also have a good gap feel here from, um, the Monday prior, which also was the start of the new quarter. This could be filled. I would love to see this field over the next few days. I think I would want to definitely buy that dip and get long on a good feel, but even the move back to the 10 day moving average, I probably would want to get long again as well. And then, um, look to see if it can go longer can most likely use this bottom point here as a stop. Anything below that is, uh, is danger for this trend, but, uh, clearly this market still wants to go higher. Clearly it's, it's, it's making up, making a case here for making all time highs inside this investor cycle and possibly also inside this second daily cycle. And I just did not think that was possible when this move started back in December and January, I did, uh, did expect, and I did ride a lot of this move up, but didn't really think we'd get too much further beyond kind of 28, 10, 28, 20 level before kind of peeling over in the next investor cycle. And then possibly by the summer making that, that move up to test all time highs. Um, so I'm surprised by the strength, but we have to respect the trend, respect how much strength we're seeing in this market at the moment. And it's been able to shrug off bearish news, you know, inverted yield curves and, and, you know, bad manufacturing data. It's been able to do that consistently and continuously. And it, of course it helps that the fed is, uh, any opportunity, just scurrying that line between, you know, saying that they will, uh, you know, remain cautious, but at the same time they will do whatever they need to do to support this market. So, um, you know, I, I would just, there's no shorting this market at the moment, it's just crazy or suicide. I don't think a short opportunity even arises until later in the investor cycle, which is not until May at the earliest. And that would be the third daily cycle. So at this point, you're either just saying, okay, this is too rich for my blood, or I don't see a trade set up. Um, but there is no short here. There's only longs as far as I'm concerned. Crude oil continues to go higher. I missed my opportunity. I did really want to get long crude back in here. I waited too long for a pullback this now up to 64, $65, exceeding my targets that I had earlier in this daily cycle thinking and make it to 62, 63. Um, but this trend also looks as if it doesn't, uh, it doesn't want to end at the moment still, uh, this, this has quite slightly different dynamics than the S and P I do mark this as an earlier day 32. I think it is daily cycle as opposed to the S and P, which I mark right here, but they do have the same characteristics. So we're not, I'm not a hundred percent sure if, if we do not have a daily cycle here, uh, like this, if that's the case, then this is still relatively early in the cycle. And, um, you know, we do know that crude does love to move kind of in these extreme, extreme, extreme types of, uh, of moves when it does get going and it looks like it's now setting up for one of those types of moves. So in theory, this really could power up towards the 65, sorry, 68 and then even $70 area. I'm not sure on what timeframe, but if it continues this type of pace, it could easily get there within 10 to 12 trading days as well, the way this is going. So, uh, again, uh, I don't see where you pick a short, even though it may be a little overboard. Um, but you know, we crude in a trend like this can stay extremely overboard for a long period of time. Um, so that's what we have to worry about. And also the cut report that I looked at this past weekend, wasn't all that extreme. It was kind of at that middle level where, um, it had reversed it's, it's, it's other extreme side and now it's kind of just moving back towards another extreme, but has plenty of time before getting there. So, uh, providing some, uh, some of the, uh, what's called a tailwind for gold. And it looks like we may have a few more days lower before completing this cycle, uh, down to maybe sort of this area or maybe even lower. And then we, we have kind of that final, probably what's going to be the final day cycle, although gold, sorry, dollar day cycles do run fairly short and quick. They, they run in sort of two to three weeks. So we could still see another daily cycle after that. It's just hard to tell point is that we do have a very clear sort of pattern up and down. We're now topped. We're now moving lower. It's providing tailwind for gold. It will reverse at some point. And this may be, and I've been saying this for a while though, but this may be provides some of the headwind for gold down into a investor cycle low, especially if we get something a little more surprising all the way back up to that sort of point. Um, that may push gold down as well. Hard to say, I think overall the dollar still continues to consolidate sideways. We have more touches on the top level here and the lows are getting higher. So this is still a bullish chart overall. And, uh, we need to be careful watch this as gold traders and gold investors as well. Uh, so I do, I do like a long-term look at this and the way it's consolidated over time. Okay guys. So that's the midweek update for today. And for this week, I'll have a full weekend report as usual until then happy trading and all the best. So,
