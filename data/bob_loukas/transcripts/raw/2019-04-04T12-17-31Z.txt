Hey good morning Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas. Thursday morning in New York, that's April the 4th. Hope you're doing really well. So let's do a quick update today on where we think the cycle stands for Bitcoin and take a look at some other coins. Don't forget tomorrow on Friday is the typical lightning round report where I go over 30 or so different coins and give you my viewpoint on that. So please leave some notes below if you want me to review anything specifically. But looking at Bitcoin here, look the only thing I can say with certainty is that we have a very positive development on the daily chart. This surge higher to break the prior confirmed cycle high or to break this at least half cycle high point is significant and cannot be discounted. This to me points to with almost, I never say with certainty, but with a very high degree of confidence that the bear market of 2018-19 is over with this December low. And of course, and I've talked about this in previous videos, coming back and doing a retest of those lows at some point in the future, probably up until August is a possibility and something we need to be aware of. But for now, the good news is that we have a very clear series of higher highs and now what's going to be higher lows. And higher highs and higher lows is essentially the definition of an uptrend or a new trend. So we have this reversal in trend after 16, 15, 16 months of pretty bearish declines here. This is very positive and to me indicates the start of the new four year cycle, a cycle that over four years, probably for three of those years will build up and build up and eventually explode again in another blow off top at some point in 2021. That's the exciting part, but we still have a lot of ground and a lot of room to cover. And I caution everybody, this is where I want to caution everybody, because a lot of people got very excited with this $1,000 move and so you should, but a lot of people did not catch any of this move except for the positions that they have, of course long, right? But from a leverage standpoint, very few are able to capture, hold and exit such a move. And I'm seeing a lot of questions. I'm seeing a lot of chatter on Twitter and other places where I think people are kind of like maybe even annoyed or envious that other people seem to have made a lot of money on this or captured the gains. And that can assure you almost nobody really did, at least not for the full extent. And then people now are talking about a continuation higher all the way up to sort of 6,000. I'm even hearing seven, 8,000 already. I mean, come on guys, we just get out of a bear market low just a month or two ago. People were shattered and complaining about how nothing was really working. And three bars, three days, everybody's already talking about seven, eight, 9,000. That's not going to happen. Not that short and not that quick. Now we could see another surge up to the $6,000 area. $6,000 area for zoom out is the, what should be now a significant resistance because it marked five, well, nearly five cycle lows an entire 2018 of hitting it and hitting it and hitting it, trying to get below. And eventually, of course it did, but that's going to act now as a lot of resistance. So if we get up there, it's going to get reversed in my opinion, but I'm not even sure if it does get up there in the next few days. I mean, it's obviously a tall ask. The uptrend that we saw is still intact. So we have kind of this really powerful speculative move still in play. We are sitting above the Bollinger Bands on the daily. So we could easily come back in before going higher again. We can spend five or seven days consolidating in a flag type pattern as well. And then going again for another 500 to $1,000 to a top, a short-term top. There are multiple scenarios here. I think the takeaway for most people, even experienced traders, is that we're in this sort of no man's land. Look at this candle from yesterday. It went as high as 53.50 and then dropped as low as 4,800. So that's a $500 move in the space of a day. Let's see if I can just zoom in on a two hour candle. Okay. So there it is. In the space of two hours, we've gone to 53.50 down to 8,400. And this is at the point where everybody started talking about, you know, on Twitter about 6,000, 7,000. I bet a lot of people are afraid of missing out, right? So that the classic FOMO got into leverage positions here and then was stopped out on this big move lower. And then what happened is, so you've got a situation where people didn't make extra profit, I guess. I mean, obviously their Bitcoin went up in value with this move, but they missed this and then lost money on the decline. And the net result is that we're still up a thousand dollars and they've lost money. I mean, that shouldn't happen. That's just that if that's happened to you, and I think it's happened to a lot of people, even if it's a small trade, just be aware of that. Make that a lesson for you to learn for the future is that you don't trade on emotions. You trade on setups and you execute on setups and then you execute out on profit on something that you've predefined. If you miss this big move, it's not a problem. It's not a big deal, right? If you're investing for the long term, that's great. You're already in, you're allocated, that's a very good development. If you're a trader, then this is just one setup of many. Okay? This is a 10% move, big deal. We had a 40%, 50% profit in ADA. Okay? So those opportunities will come daily and weekly and daily and weekly throughout the next year or two. So this is just a trade. And if you're really panicking or just concerned or envious that you missed out on such a move and you're sort of kicking yourself, don't. It's just another trade, right? And especially, again, like I said, if your trading accounts are denominated in BTC, some are trading with sort of the stable coins. But if you're BTC, there's even more reason not to worry because you still had exposure at a one-to-one level to Bitcoin and what happened here. So just be aware of that. That's a very important lesson as a trader for you to learn. Not only as an active trader, but somebody who's a passive kind of trader who's actively trading on a slower timeframe, maybe on a weekly sort of basis. A lot of them kind of just added in right here. They had all this time here, all this time to add to more positions, but now they've taken another position, a thousand dollars later. Okay. Because they wanted it supposedly a thousand dollars lower. Now they're paying the price. So you got to be more diligent. You got to be more thoughtful in what it is you want to do, what timeframes you want to be trading on and how you want to execute trades going forward. Okay. Let's get going. This was not a scheduled report today. Normally I do a Wednesday report. Let's quickly cover what I see on the cycle. So here, this is a case of rear vision mirror cycle work. Cycles are a reflection of price. They're not a something I front run with. At the moment we have a little bit of, let's call it lack of clarity on where the cycle may be. This here to me indicates that we are now starting sort of a bullish trend. What I mean by that is we don't have a clear cycle low. We have in the timing band, a consolidation in price and then a surge out of it. And whenever we get huge surges out of consolidations late in the cycle, I tend to mark the bar before the increase as the cycle low and call this a time-based cycle low. Now go back to my Friday video, I think it was, or actually Monday's video. I talked about time-based cycle low. I talked about the fact that this could be coming, this could be leading to a surge like this based on a time-based cycle low. The only thing I did say that didn't happen was the fact that if we were looking for a time-based cycle low, I was looking for that to happen more like this weekend coming. So into sort of the weekend and then a move higher, if that was the case. That didn't happen. Instead, we had a surge on day 55, which was slightly in the timing band. So right now it's a wait and see. We may have to remark this somewhat as we see price develop. And for example, let me just move this out. If we get an immediate pullback from this point, so we get something like, something like this now, okay, and form a low right around the initial breakout point. And then we start to go higher again. Then this gets remarked for sure. And then this means we had just a very late cycle surge, very bullish still, because then this is no longer the cycle high. This becomes the cycle high, day 56 high. This becomes like a day 65 low, for example. And then we push this out. Okay, nice and neat. We just have to wait and see how the market gives us. If though, we continue for many more days, kind of chopping around and moving higher at this point, and then come down later on, that's a new cycle. Okay, that to me means here's this, that remains the cycle low. This is a new cycle. This is the higher of the new cycle. And then we're looking for a cycle low at some point sort of in June. Okay, I think from here on, we're going to probably and don't hold me to this, because again, this we're in no man's land right here. And we're still technically kind of in this crypto winter phase. It takes if you look at prior four year cycle beginnings, it takes around six months or so to kind of get out of that basement level in prices. And they're considered this kind of the basement, where in between sort of the lows at 3000 3100 to 6000, we're gonna I think we're gonna chop in that area for a very long time. So just be aware of that. So I think price here in the next cycle can chop around, come back down. And then it's not maybe until August, that we kind of get a sort of a weakness in the market again, and a real test down to levels seen in February, maybe even December, it's hard to say. But I think it'd be very unlikely if this here is the lowest you get, since the lows of a bear market, and you just keep going higher. Typically, there's always at least one very significant test, retest, shake out, call it what you want bear trap. But you typically will get something really scary coming back. And looking at this chart 1000 to 2000 move back down at some point is what I would consider scary. Okay, let's go over a quick couple of positions that I'm opening, give you an idea. ADA, for example, closed out the second, third for really significant profit around about 60% on $1800 push, push as high as 1940, that's really good. I'm holding my final third now as more of a long term position. But I do have a stop right here below this candle. And this candle is associated with a Bitcoin surge that we saw yesterday or the day before. So around about 1450. Here it is right below give it some room. 1450 is my stop on this. That's well above my entry point. I've already got two thirds of my position cashed and banked for a good profit. And the reason why I want to hold this is that if alts continue to experience a major move and a major run, I as I pointed out here a month ago when I drew this this trend line in, we have the opportunity here to go as high as 2300 and then maybe even sort of higher 2800 and above. Obviously, it would take a lot of time to get there. But I want some exposure. I have a really strong hand in this now with my position. I've made some good profit. So it's easy for me to hold should be easy for you to hold as well. If you took the same trade, the rest of it's beautiful, beautifully profitable. And the worst case is if this reverses and this fizzles fizzles out that even the final third position will still make a profit. So that's how I'm trading this going forward. I'm not going to cover it too much now going forward. Just know that I'm keeping my third position for the for kind of the long haul going forward. XMR is another position I have open here. It's reversed all the way back was looking so solid. And now it's come all the way back. Let's see what happens here. Not not haven't got much room left here before being stopped out. Gonna give it a chance to get back up and out of the out of the triangle pattern here. XMR versus the reason why I'm only holding right now is XMR versus the dollar still looks really good. So XMR is doing really well. Bitcoin has just just outperformed essentially. So I want to give this a little bit of an opportunity. If Bitcoin kind of stabilizes or drops a little bit, maybe this will have another run higher and get back up as well. But this one now is below my entry point and just you know, it's on a watch list for getting stopped out. I won't let it go below kind of this level here. Kind of the breakout point that occurred last week. Okay guys, and then lastly, I posted a public video on the site here. I will put a link into that video in the comments below. But essentially I went over the four year cycle and the opportunity ahead. This is very good for investors, very good for all of us to kind of keep in mind where the potential prize is out a couple of years, something we really want to be focused on investing towards and mindful of. So take a look at that video. I think you'll enjoy it. It's around about a 40 minute video posted for free on the blog here. Thanks very much. Any comments below and tomorrow is the lightning report. All the best.
