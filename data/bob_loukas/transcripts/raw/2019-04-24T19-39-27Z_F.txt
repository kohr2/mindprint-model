Hey good afternoon Fintap members it's Bob Lucas around 3 20 p.m eastern standard time in New York on the 24th about 40 minutes before the close looking at gold here had a good recovery today with a dollar up sharply so that's a an interesting development here at the moment uh yesterday we did see a good clean break of of somewhat of a flag pattern that developed over the past four days the uh the consolidation there was pretty much expected considering we had five pretty steep red candles before that and then leading yesterday to this breakdown i thought we would just continue going lower and lower and lower over the next five days it reversed yesterday formed a little bit of a hammer candle and today we're looking at a green candle it's come all the way up today to the what's the high almost um 12.79 so interesting here i i think well i'm still fairly comfortable or confident that we are still in this icl decline this to me is still not enough for an icl to form it's also fairly early in this daily cycle so pulling back here to me is still just a counter trend move in what should be a decline down to the icl more likely at the end of the month or early next month um we are now only touching the 10-day moving average so at this point i think a full close a daily candle close above or even come certainly comfortably above the 10-day moving average is a warning that we have bottomed for gold um now again the structure of this now that we are in decline tells me that we should have another leg lower if we measure kind of the daily cycle high at 13 10 down to this 12 70 area it's a 50 move this is consolidation of that 50 move another 50 move say from the middle gets us down to around about 12 25 12 30 areas so that's where i'm still targeting and looking for i think again like i said before any move back above 10 day certainly any move back above 20 day moving average is a sign that we probably have bottomed and i want to get out of my position so overall i'm still fairly short gold that gold position has not changed for me uh lowering my stops as we go down give it some room above kind of this 12 80 areas like a 12 84 for example 12 85 is more than enough at this point anything above that then it's no point in giving back a good part of the profit that you may have uh also when you look at uh let's take a look at dust for example so dust um pretty big candle yesterday took some profit uh half profit on the position um started off this morning very strongly has come all the way back down so that's a function of gdx let's look at gdx here so gdx is looking a little similar to gold so we did see the clean break so we now have the daily cycle decline and the break um came down below the bollinger bands and now has reversed kind of nicely today um so you know people are like oh that's it it's over my experience with the miners is that you know you're going to get many more uh you get a few of these counter trend moves and reactions and then continuous declines this is just not enough as far as i'm concerned and now especially since it has broken down i think it wants to keep going lower at this point i'm going to flip over to a weekly this is dust on the weekly gdx on the weekly so look we did break the 10 and 20 week moving averages which was expected we broke that channel that i've been talking about on the uh in the week in the weekly reports so we kind of broke this uh investor cycle channel that we had but we have not come down on huge volume just yet and we have not come down to test or touch the lower bollinger bands like i like to see on almost every icl decline every icl decline going back look at all those lows um typically will as as you see there typically we'll always hit the lower bollinger bands at some point we're nowhere near though at the moment so oops sorry about that um i think we still have a little more room to go uh seeing a one or two day balance is not expected because gdx is down around about 10 percent from the recent highs only a few weeks back another reason for taking some of the profit in dust it had a nice move higher i wanted to be able to sit a little more comfortably in a profitable position knowing that i took half of my position as profit so now a little more comfortable in riding the rest and potentially giving back if for example the miners have found and gold has found found the bottom and you know dust starts coming back down like this obviously at some point we'll get stopped i don't mind getting stopped at a at a rising stop level if or because we took half of the profit already at this point so that's another reason why i took some profit on that in that position switching to the s p now interesting day 32 today a little bit kind of like a spinning top there i think yesterday today was a slightly higher high so a swing a swing high could occur tomorrow this is 31 days to the current high which is around about what you expect we also potentially could expect a shorter cycle because we had a slightly longer cycle for daily cycle number one so i think now that we're just shy of all-time highs it's very possible that we do top for the daily cycle start to come lower and that's going to be something the bears are going to jump all over and talk about big double tops from the all-time high that we're very close to at the moment i know the nasdaq has made an all-time high so the russell is nowhere near but i think people are going to call this if it does form a daily cycle top they're going to call this a double top with the all-time high call for you know the bear market to decline to to take hold i don't see that i see this coming back down i see a nice little retracement and maybe not even as far as this down into the second daily cycle low and then a move higher to new all-time highs now i don't know or have too much of a strong opinion on where we go in the third daily cycle and where we go for this investor cycle and also where we go for the remainder of 2019 but i do think we're going to get all-time highs and i do think we're going to get those comfortably then we'll see if the market wants to create a trap a huge bull trap just above or maybe five three or five percent above all-time highs it is possible i just don't want to um i don't want to necessarily be strongly biased in any one way what i do know is that we have a pretty significant rally and trend in place since december and even zooming out all the way out we have seen periods of consolidation over a year or so that have led to higher moves uh the only thing about this one is that it's actually if you think about it goes back to all the way here so yeah it's a little it's a year and a half again as well um there's enough kind of feel in this area here let's see if i can kind of just rectangle that out there's enough in this area here if you look at prior moves to propel the market much higher so we had uh one sort of similar move in 15 probably even longer right maybe even as long as that so around about almost two years i think that one was which then led to this massive move and then of course we had the big uh one here in 2011. it's possible we have another one of these types of developments here consolidation over a year or more and if that's the case then we could look at possibly another four or five hundred point move in the s p if not if not more like a 600 point move a 20 rally at some point uh next the end of this year and then into next year as well just something to be aware of just thinking a little uh outside the box i guess a little more longer term for now though um i i don't want to be shorting or discounting this i think any short opportunity comes on the third daily cycle that's where you may be looking for a short i think if we get a good pullback certainly below the 20-day moving average i will buy uh leverage long a reversal below the 20-day moving average okay similar look for crude this um is now probably even gone beyond my expectations but what i've been saying the entire way you want to be long this or stay out of its way when crude oil gets in a it gets into this type of sort of mood like it did going down and now like it has going up it's sustained and it is pretty it's a pretty significant and extreme type of move um i think this could or should pull back as well i think the daily cycle is more likely to be aligned with the s p cycle currently i think i have it in my reports marked right here it's hard to say um there's a couple of different you know possibilities here but if it aligns with the equity cycle then we can look for kind of a top as well in this excuse me in this region and then look for a cycle low coming up something like this and then form the cycle low and then go again make another attempt at some pretty big move maybe even get a move above 70 or easily above 70 and then see what happens from that point all right all right to the dollar and what the hell is going on this is the strangest type of move we had a one two three fourth daily cycle expected to come down sort of test this area or somewhere at least to the bottom of this rising support line it has not done that it has rallied really sharply um it it questions the count on the weekly cycle as well but we are making deep investor cycle highs here but also more importantly we've taken out the last eight daily cycle highs and we are now at multi-year highs going back to 2017 so almost two years since the last high this can only be bullish except for of course a big bull trap but you know expecting and thinking and hoping for bull traps is a pretty much a loser's pro you know a loser's position to take because they don't occur most of the time the market goes with the prevailing trend prevailing trend since early 2018 from these lows is higher i gotta think that we are going to be moving higher out of this as well so on the weekly chart there's only one interpretation here and that we're on week 15 of the weekly cycle don't see any other icls right here this is a short cycle if it was only around about 11 weeks doesn't doesn't make any sense that that would be a cycle low as far as i'm concerned um so price now well and truly above the 10-week moving average made new hires exceeded the last investor cycle high we now have one two and wherever this high settles would be three consecutive low highs higher highs and we have a minimum of one two higher lows obviously the definition of a long-term cyclical uptrend gotta respect this as much as i don't like to see this from a from a goal perspective uh gotta respect what i'm seeing in this in this chart pattern here and if this is an ascending triangle that breaks then you've got pretty much a significant move maybe up to the 101 102 area as its potential the only thing the bulls will have to be concerned with is that like i said before the weekly cycle counts so we could uh be looking at a sort of final drive impulse not so much impulse but final drive in this investor cycle up to this point that gets everybody thinking we have a clean breakout come back down and form the icl and basically break the ascending chart a triangle pattern that's developed alternatively what we could be looking at in a more bullish case for the dollar and let me get a different color is that we continue to confirm the breakout come back down test the breakout point which is not uncommon in a breakout of a triangle pattern and then continue higher that would be a valid chart chart pattern i should say um as opposed to one that breaks down and forms an icl here so that would be somewhat of a shallow icl let's move this to there and that one is the blue okay that's the board i'm sorry but that one becomes the blue investor cycle low the green investor cycle sorry the the red investor cycle low chart would be down this area which would negate that and then in that case we would be looking for then a top also in the three-year cycle and then a move lower as well i know a lot of the kind of gold bugs dollar bears kind of or not kind of a really gung-ho on this type of pattern but they've been sort of going home on a breakdown for the longest time there was a big there was talk of a head and shoulders top right here for the longest time that didn't work then there was talk of a double top with this that has now not worked now people are talking about it and what i just what i just described here which is a sort of a false breakout or a bull trap then come back down and lower and i i i don't favor that opinion only because again the way this consult this has consolidated bullishly every time it tried to drop drop in daily cycles it continued higher and and found support and now it's sort of breaking out and higher as well so this is the the one sort of concerning part now you could also argue that back on the daily the last two candles have been extremely bullish and powerful and gold has actually moved higher so what's all that all about so there's something to possibly be said here maybe there's something more going on overall in the market with a dollar up and gold up but you know i find a couple of day correlations can exist where you don't expect them to and then the true or the expected correlation when this case being sort of a negative correlation comes through and then you start seeing more of that so that's what i think it will happen eventually so that's my update for this week hope you enjoyed it i'll have a full weekend report out on sunday take care and all the best
