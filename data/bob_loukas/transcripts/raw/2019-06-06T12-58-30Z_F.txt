hey good morning fintech members it's bob lucas thursday morning here in new york around 8 40. so let's go over the midweek update here we have some really exciting developments on the the gold front this chart looks phenomenal right here we have a really really significant burst or breakout clearly without any doubt we are in a finally in a new weekly cycle a new investor cycle we are only some eight trading days into what could be a you know 26 or 30 week cycle which could also include 16 or 18 weeks of upside there is so much potential here i can't even begin to to really um describe how much potential there is because we had the consolidation of the last cycle only drop by around about 80 in price over a 10 week or even more 12 week period but within five trading days we're right back up to sort of 2019 highs we're only some sort of 15 or 16 20 away from that level so the fact that we're there so quickly in the investor cycle with potentially 16 weeks ahead is obviously extremely bullish now there will be some upside i would think there would be some upside resistance at this level if we zoom out we know that there's a lot of attempts at this level but the fact that we're coming close already to to looking at testing that level only in the first couple of weeks of this investor cycle to me is is very promising and it gives me the idea or the sense that once we test this maybe once or twice in the first cycle the first daily cycle that we may even get a break of that key support sorry key resistance line and then burst right through and if that's the case we have let's see if we can zoom out a little bit now we have pretty much a lot of open territory from that point if you look at this area here which obviously is now stale right there there isn't any uh any people sort of locked in at any certain price but just from a from a chart perspective if you look at kind of this level here during the bull market for those people that trade it was kind of that blow off top period it occurred only over you know four or five weeks i think it was so that level here to me is very artificial uh in terms of price so about 1500 to 1900 and then we had that big chop area for over you know over a year of two years before it dropped so i think there's a level in here uh right here that we can get to fairly quickly and you know i i just i think if we can break out of this 1370 1380 resistance area that there could be this sort of vacuum where gold can can rally by 150 or 200 points and get to sort of the 1500 or 1550 area even within this investor cycle i know that sounds aggressive and i'm not suggesting necessarily that that's my primary expectation but it's certainly a possibility right here of course we have to break out of this 1370 area it started off really well but you know it could stall there's no there's nothing stopping it obviously from stalling but overall this is just very promising action i'm excited about this haven't been excited about the action and goal for quite a while i've always sort of viewed all these rallies investor cycle rallies that we've had over the last couple of years as just sort of not necessarily counter trending but just forming of a base and this base has taken a nice amount of time which is good for the longer term but now with this type of action here this type of move um it feels it feels as if it wants to go and get out of this base and establish new territory so i'm excited about that crossing my fingers at this point obviously when i've been positioned for it um but look this is looking really good and the fact that it's not it's really not pulling back there's been a couple of sellers but it's being bought right back that to me is very promising also looking at silver this morning silver is finally making a little bit of a move had a big pullback yesterday but regained all those all that whole pullback quickly today and is now back at the upper bolliger bands we have a 10 crossing the 20 day moving average that's also bullish this to me looks like we can get at least another one of these types of runs that we saw in the last investor cycle that is around about i think a 20 plus percent move which which would put us in this case up to around about the 1650 area that's significant so i want to hold my long position here may even consider holding through um through kind of the first daily cycle there's a possibility that we just keep going and going and going we've seen that with silver before for example here here's the first daily cycle uh or actually maybe in the third the way it was marked but regardless if we have this type of move coming uh you see right here there was a tendency to maybe take profit right at this level thinking it's going to come back down and it really didn't come back down and then there was this big move so i don't want to kind of have a situation where taking profit in something like silver when it can just keep going and going and then looking at the miners that they they've performed really well uh almost a rocket shoot out of this concert consolidation area almost back to highs that we saw in february not too far away from that i think it continues higher today i think it keeps going obviously uh there'll be some nasty pullbacks that's expected we saw them even in this move here pullbacks pullbacks that's just the way the miners trade we have to be aware of that but for now sitting long keeping the positions i'm i have my eye more on sort of a 26 to 27 dollar area for gdx and that could be or that would be at least a 20 or 30 percent move from here so i want to take advantage of that again it's still early in the investor cycle so i just want to pay attention to that okay stocks here stocks looks like we could be getting stopped out on my futures position here it's more around this uh um yeah looking at this candle right here so we're close to that i i raised this i lowered the stop somewhat on the on the sds um classification on the uh the portfolio because it's not aligned well with this candle i think anything above that is a reason to to be getting out but the fact that gold is rallying really well and crude looks horrible i think this is just a fake move i think it's going to reverse i think because also we have the failed cycle in place if we draw that cycle low right here where the cycle is this is the top we have a clean break so this to me should be counter trending but could go a little higher so i want to give a little more space on the stops um before uh you know before calling throwing the towel in and calling it quits on on on s p uh looking at it from the spx standpoint yeah so here's the cycle low here's a cycle high here's the breakdown this would be the uh the absolute top for the move but then again we um you know look how we we're up at 20 day moving average i think we'll pop above it today when the market opens this is the cash price we're looking at um but then i'm thinking maybe we get a doji candle today and then we start reversing lower as well so that's what i'm looking at for stocks stocks for crude uh much much more bearish view right here this has been something i i've pretty much uh tracked really well to date um had a nice position took some profit yesterday because we do have a significant drop that's a ten dollar drop and the position was so so um in the profitable uh stance here so i had to take some profit i felt i'm not sure if i would reload short but i'm going to hold the other short position and to see what it gives us if this gives us something similar to this then i want to be a part of that so we could be looking at a move all the way back down to 42 dollars which is another 20 decline or a 10 decline so i want to be at least positioned but i have enough leverage now with the position i have to take advantage of that and i don't think you know i think this could rally back all the way to 56 57 still be in a very bearish state so i i just want to have the stops kind of up in this area here for now 58 level maybe even sort of 50 this candle here the top of this candle sort of 57 area for now i know that's a lot of room to give up but we need to give it some room if we want to take advantage of a decline of this nature and then lastly looking at um the the dollar we have a failed daily cycle the first failed data cycle since kind of over here which was only very brief this is a clean break we now have finally one two three four five the kind of the sixth daily cycle here that's failing that tells me that obviously the weekly cycle has topped which is not surprising it's it's pretty advanced at the moment then we should be looking at a cycle low pretty soon just the way the cycles have behaved recently kind of a very consistent day 15 to day 20 cycle length we should get a cycle low and then a quick top in the next cycle something like this and then we get down into the final cycle to complete the the weekly cycle and this is where i think gold can really take off especially if we get something like this come down uh gold can really have a really nice run um to the top that's the midweek update i hope you enjoyed it some good positions going here if equities can can also conform to what we're looking at it would be really really nice but for the moment just stay strong in the goal positions the market looks really good for gold and the miners there will be shakeouts i think we just let this ride because it could be a very nice summer the way it's the way it's structured right now all the best
