Hey, good morning Fintech members. That's Bob Lucas here on Thursday morning around 8.30am in New York. I hope you're all doing really well. This is your midweek update. So looking at gold, we definitely have a rejection near the 20-day moving average. This now looks like we have a half cycle low in play as I kind of pointed out this weekend. Have a rejection here in the second half of the cycle and it looks like now gold is going to head down into the final ICO decline. So this looks like the second half of this daily cycle and the final component of the investor cycle. We have not really seen any significant selling. I mean, obviously it topped back in February, so it's been a while since it topped. But we've seen a very mild and almost calculated decline since the top. We have 36, 37 weeks since the last cycle low. It looks like it's almost going to be a year before it's all ended and done. And it actually may even end up being almost a year where this becomes one big yearly cycle with an indistinguishable midpoint or investor cycle low. But I don't really want to focus too much on that right now. I think what we're seeing for here is the final level or the final leg of the investor cycle decline. Have not seen capitulation and we like to see capitulation in all ICO declines. This is setting up well for that. Silver is already showing, even though it's green this morning, it's already showing us a clear, yesterday clear decline and a new low for the investor cycle. So it's leading the way. Miners are not too far behind. I think gold is ready to fall down. We had the Fed come out yesterday and say fairly dovish commentary. So I think that's also helped push gold lower. But at the same time, gold, when it's in a declining phase, will take any catalyst to continue lower. So I do think we're going to get lower. I think we're going to get lower down towards just looking at this kind of this area here, this cycle low back in December. This cycle high in October. I think the both of those are candidates for where gold ends up. Another sort of $40, $30 or $40 below where we are today. Nothing all that significant really when you consider the highs at around about $1340, $1350. Only $100 or so decline. That's pretty normal for a gold investor cycle as well. That's what I'm looking for right now, staying short, remaining in this position and see if we can get a puke and a real significant sell-off below both the daily and the weekly Bollinger Bands. Looking at stocks, and I think stocks have topped for this daily cycle. We are well and truly in the timing band for a top. We have new all-time highs now, clearly printed. And we had a good decline yesterday on the Fed news. I guess the market was looking for a little more out of the Fed, maybe an acknowledgement that they could even cut rates if needed. They pretty much said that they would keep rates as is for now. So I think that will... Crude oil has already shown us a top, as I pointed out this past weekend. It is around five or six days ahead of the equity market cycle and clearly now moving down to the next daily cycle low. It looks like we're already at the lower Bollinger Bands, and I think we're going to smash right through them at some point. Looks like maybe even by today. But the low could come in well and truly below $61 at some point, even though we may bounce back a little bit, retest kind of that declining 10-day moving averages. It's very soon going to drop below the 20-day moving average. And then over the next three or four days, find that low somewhere probably above $60 and then rally back up in the third daily cycle. I would think crude also, like the equity markets, eventually end up rallying up and taking out that prior high for the second daily cycle as it moves higher. And then at that point, it's just a matter of where does the investor cycle for risk markets in general want to go? Is it a right translated third cycle again, or do we have more of a left translated cycle or middle translated cycle? Hard to say, but I think a good opportunity to get long exists once this turns, forms a swing, and maybe gets back above the 10-day moving average. Pretty oversold at the moment, but we know crude that can continue and remain oversold for a very long period of time. And then the dollar here. I think we have a bit of a bull trap here. I was talking about if this was kind of a big ascending triangle that was going to move higher for the dollar, that we wanted to see the dollar continue significantly higher, and then come back to test the breakout point as the investor cycle low. Now, it's already come back down. It's broken back below the breakout point, and it looks like this is now just a trap. So I think what we're going to probably see because of that, maybe a little more of a rally, but then essentially looking for the investor cycle low decline portion to come in sooner than later. It's not overdue or anything like that necessarily, but we certainly passed the halfway point or midpoint now, and the last ICL was back in January. So we should be expecting an ICL around about the mid-June to July timeframe as it's drawn here on this chart. So it's just a matter of now of looking for the next top here, and then I think we do get a month or two lower, and that should help gold as well. But we could have one more good, maybe even a test up to sort of double test, stretch it out a little more. That's also a possibility. Really hard to say at this point, but I think we're going to find that this becomes a top and a trap for this ICL. But there's no significant clue here on where it wants to go zooming out longer term. Just because this may be a bull trap, I don't think it necessarily means that we're going to have sort of a top on a sort of three-year cycle timeframe. Too early to tell. Five or six candles is not enough for me. So it's just a matter of being a little more patient here, and we're just waiting for this ICL to come out, and then to see kind of where that next rally, and how far the rally takes us in the next ICL, the next IC that's due from the summer and on. That's the mid-week update. I'll have an update, of course, a full week update on the weekend. All the best to you.
