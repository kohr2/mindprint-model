you back early in the week and I think that was expected it was a really nice move to the 10-day moving average and then bounced pretty sharply from that point had a three four day nice rally up to new highs and then on Friday we had this really significant reversal intraday off a 1360 print which was great I mean that's highs we haven't seen in a couple of years confirming the fact in my opinion that making new highs and multi-year highs in the first daily cycle is going to tell us that we should we should at least expect or hope for a pretty significant rally in this investor cycle likely come in the second daily cycle or even even the third into the third daily cycle as well but I don't really like the the nature of that candle that we saw on Friday the the reversal was about $20 coming back which is significant so I think there's a chance now that we saw a four-day rally in the second half of the cycle so when we came back down form the half cycle low and then rally for four days now we could be looking at a move back it's not depicted so much in this chart here because only because the cycle count typically in the first day so I will go up to around about day 23 24 before a high but just watch out for this candle here I think we could be looking and move back to say 1325 maybe even sort of double bottom off the half cycle low and then continue higher I think overall though for the cycle I'm still bullish not so much for the first daily cycle but for the investor cycle but in theory the first daily cycle as long as it stays and remains above the 10-day moving average on a closing basis it's still bullish and I would respect this newfound uptrend that we've we have here but any close below the 10-day moving average from this point going forward probably tells us that the first daily cycle is in decline now first daily cycles in a nice uptrend typically won't more spend too much time moving backwards and we did have this three days going back already so if we are in a declining phase for this daily cycle we already had these three days and only four days up so we may not get we may not see a whole lot of downside action and more consolidation than anything else so maybe a move down kind of test this candle from early last week maybe chop around a little bit and then just move higher especially if we're looking at sort of a really bullish investor cycle that are like I hope we are then we just could be looking for some some consolidation some slight profit taking and then move higher again and let's see on the on the let's actually go to the the miners first because that's what I have in the report yeah and and look at the miners we've got three solid weeks higher recovered the entire investor cycle decline that was over at about 10 weeks so in three weeks we've come back up sort of a double top in some way so this could also be rolling over but at the same time you know when the miners get going they just keep on going so I don't want to be losing position here at this point if I'm long the miners you want to just stay long although like I said don't be surprised with a little bit of a pull back here or at least sort of a flag over two or three weeks kind of consolidate this big move which is around about 15% higher which is not actually not that much for for the miners when you consider this move and other ones in the past they can really get going so don't you know don't feel as if it's overbought at this point you need to take profit you want to because it's the first daily cycle you want to remain long yeah the other thing that a little that concerns me a little bit here is the cut report and the position that the large specs have built up as you see here in the the count decent amount of contracts built up long over the last two or three weeks and then the short position has dropped quite a bit commercials have also dumped a decent amount here and starting to get a little a little short as well far far from a timing or a good timer of tops and bottoms but still something to watch out for gonna keep an eye on this I think it just means that people are jumping in pretty pretty significantly here and if if gold can break above that 1370 area I think you'll see this become even more lopsided but you know it tells us that maybe for the investor cycle we may not be getting a long sort of 15 16 weeks to a top type of cycle but maybe something where it's like eight to ten weeks atop but with more significant price action to the upside the bleeds report is only on well not it has dropped significantly to 16 and when it gets to zero that typically means it's it's about to turn and about the top so we have to watch that but still early and typically the bleeds will get to zero and then stay at zero for three or four maybe even six weeks before a top occurs so I think it's still early but it's sort of that first warning sign that we have to be a little mindful here but gold has gone pretty you know up pretty pretty quickly and here in the short term so it's not surprising to see speculators jump up here we did have a bit of a sell-off during the week so that may have corrected the cut structure a little bit and it's not reflected in this price action right here yeah and not much more here that can add on the weekly level I mean overall when you just take a step back we look at this 27 weeks higher I mean it didn't really didn't move too much for 27 weeks but it came back to that significant resistance area that we've talked about for so long what I do find bullish is the fact that we spent 12 weeks almost three months here declining but only dropped $100 in price so I think there was a lot of accumulation that was going on here the bond market was also rallying more recently as well and of course equity markets crude have have taken taken a hit I think this is just telling us that there is definitely a flight to safety of going on some hedging going on here in the markets this allowed gold to kind of stay up here without dropping into more of a capitulation like investor cycle low as you see in the past that you typically see and that's why I think we're so quickly back up to test that resistance area and slightly popped above it for intraday but made new high so a higher high here and a higher low at the investor cycle level I think overall it's just very bullish but again I think we have overhead supply here we have some resistance to work through and that's why I think we may end up bouncing off that or have already bounced off that but may come back a little bit retrace kind of reload somewhat little profit taking and then make that move in the second daily cycle to come up to to test and break through and then hopefully not not really look back I think there's a lot of room and a lot of thin air above gold above that 1370 area if we do get above that I can see a move to 1500 very very rapidly and we've seen similar hundred dollar moves you know all over the place in gold it's not something that's terribly difficult for gold to accomplish it did that here in three weeks or so in the earlier parts of this investor cycle I think it's just a matter of how does gold respond here again at this 1370 level it's a definitely a very psychological level I think everybody has looked at this chart is looking at this and it's looking at these levels so it's definitely playing a role for for traders and it's not until we get through that resistance area that I think the longs will start to repile in and that ends up becoming probably flipped over to a support level as well so something to watch out here again overall I'm very bullish slightly slightly mindful or at least prepared for a pullback of around 30 maybe even 40 dollars same for silver same for the miners prepared for a little pullback but I think overall looking at the investor cycle and looking at the summer months this looks bullish to me okay all right the equity market is a little more difficult here and we have a kind of a cycle pattern here that does actually show up every now and then not too often but it is one of these indecisive type chart patterns and I'll explain we have a clear 44 day cycle low seven days from the top that's perfect we had this move higher here and then come down for a failed cycle but since have rallied back up and taken out this high that was a day three high so we have you know we have this indecisive type action with a failed cycle but then I move to new highs I favor the bearish side not because I'm biased in the longer term for a top but purely because this is the third daily cycle and the last cycle low at the investor cycle level was back in December so we're due now for the declining phase of the cycle I don't think that means we have to have a bull market top it doesn't mean we have to have the start of a savage sort of bear market to begin it just means that I think the investor cycle low needs to occur and I think this is more of a sort of a counter trend move let's call it another bull trap like this one possibly was here at the second daily cycle but again I favor this rolling over even though we do have a lot of bullish signs here we have a cross back over the 10 day moving average RSI is pretty good the market is keen to be bid a lot of people want to buy this market we have the Fed talking it up a lot of catalysts a lot of reasons why we should be very mindful that we could still just go higher to make new highs as well the equity market has been surprising us for many many years now in this bull market it has been almost made famous by its ability when weak or when on the ground to get back up and to keep going so I just want to be mindful of that looking for possibly for another short but not while it's above the 10 day moving average there was one opportunity here on the swing high to maybe get in front of it because the stop would be very tight but again you know this this market has proven very difficult to short as as is evident by the fact that I was stopped out last week when it came back up here so I'm just mindful of that and don't necessarily want to get short don't want to get long because it is a third daily cycle we're already up you know almost you know 130 140 points here from from this low so I think it's too late for that so just staying on the sidelines and paying attention more than anything else for now another reason why I don't want to probably take a crack at a short is that we did get back above the 10 day moving average we had a big 10 week moving average big big candle here at the reversal you know I've got a lot of the indicators here already sort of saying well hey maybe that was the icl and it's possible unlikely but possible that we had a very sort of strange sort of daily cycle the third day cycle being sort of a cycle that didn't end correctly for some reason whether it's let's just say you know sort of fed talk and then this becomes the icl it does it's really an anomaly it doesn't look right but some of these indicators here kind of look like some of what you'd see during an icl so I don't know if we go on to make new highs here it could be one of those sort of blow off top type moves where we get this short but maybe short six to eight weeks sort of rally that just keeps on going so something strange about this action here again that's the reason why I don't want to be shorting a back above the 10 week moving average is always at least a positive sign for the market so even though the candle is kind of a topping candle kind of a topping doji there but overall indecisive could go either way I favor the downside I've marked it this way again I don't see a complete icl I can see a clear-cut investor cycle top so I want to see one more move down it doesn't have to go too far lower get down below the Bollinger Bands here at former low probably by July at some point maybe even into August and then rally again we could even have an inverse head and shoulders forming here here's the one ice one icl another icl here and of course the big correction that we saw into December could actually be the makings of another big big rally that come after that it's hard to say of course for now just respecting what the chart's telling me and staying away from it from both a long and a short perspective crude oil though continues to be weak and and this is another reason why I still still kind of favor the bearish side for equities this this chart still is bearish it tried to come back from a sell-off last week or the week before it hit the 10-day moving average in a counter trend move or a decline that is pretty normal and expected especially when you get these pretty significant declines snap back to the 10-day moving average come back down snap back again to the 10-day moving average now if it does make another rally and and burst through the 10-day moving average you would definitely want to respect that and you want to use the candle right here to form your stopping point to get out I think any move now back above is clear separation from the 10-day moving average and back above this candle puts in a new higher high and I think at least is a warning sign or a reason to cut your your short positions take the profit that's there and and just don't mess around because crude when it gets when it swings and changes direction it just goes so it could you know could easily make a move back to $60 and still be in sort of an overall bearish mode or structure but for me I still favor this to a downside move mostly also because the cycle count is not really ready for a turn we are still looking for the big ICL this third daily cycle is still a little early to form a low one more decline over sort of seven to ten days would be perfect getting down to the $46 level as well would be would be great from from this point and that would be a sort of fitting third and final failed daily cycle as far as I'm concerned and then on the weekly chart that kind of just just shows you what I'm looking at here we did get these two big candles that really has messed around with all the indicators put them into sort of an oversold reading a couple of attempts here on the weekly level see the wicks down to the Bollinger Bands to be sold off so there was some support in this area so just going to be again a little mindful if we get a close above these two candles here we could be looking at some type of low in place and again doesn't look ready for an ICL from a timing standpoint but you have to respect price if it does move higher at this point we could we could have an ICL of some short ICL at some point at some of some type when you look at these candles again though I still favor one more move lower that would be a more consistent cycle a cycle low and a full cycle and at that point here I think once we get down and once we make another reversal in this area that would be the point to get out and close any short position you have because that would be kind of pushing your luck beyond that point as well so crude overall still looks bearish to me when crude is in a decline of this nature when even an uptrend when it's in it went in a significant uptrend or downturn like this it typically does go on for a lot longer than you expect and this to me doesn't look ready just to turn and find a low just going to finish up with the dollar and Bitcoin dollar here it really hasn't the action here hasn't changed the analysis hasn't changed looking at a cycle low here looking for a very early top in this cycle because it should be the last daily cycle then we're looking at the final failed left translate daily cycle to cut to occur that gets us down into the DCL final cycle for the for the investor cycle and the ICL as well and here it is at the weekly level topped on date on week 19 that's pretty clear as far as I'm concerned we're now moving lower down to this lower boundary of this sort of rising wedge I don't know if that provides any real support I'm not sure how you know how how much the market's paying attention to something like this for me it's more of a guide than anything else but there is there are a couple of touch points at least three of them that make it somewhat relevant in my opinion but still my point is that we are in this declining phase of the cycle looking for an ICL then we get the rally as well from that point but it's also possible that this just falls right through the bottom of this wedge and the sell-off becomes even more pronounced again the the buyer should be to the downside because the cycle count is on week 22 but again also looking for that ICL to form at some point and lastly just finishing up with Bitcoin it's been very bullish of late it was looking like we were rolling over here a week ago but we have since rallied up a long Bitcoin from the 8200 area I think we could be even though we had this big candle here we were four hundred dollars three or four hundred dollars in the last six hours of recording it's now Sunday here and I think this is telling us that maybe we have a short-term top in place going maybe back down to this 87 88 and 100 level which I think is somewhat of a breakout point even though we have a couple of weeks over here top of these the bodies of the candles here tell me that we had this breakout I think we come back down but I think we could be looking now at the move up towards 10,000 and above even though it sounds almost you know too good to be true we have come from the three and a half to four thousand dollar level and they're only a few months so Bitcoin still looks really strong now this looks like a pretty big consolidation period here early in the cycle and now we're making that move higher of course could be a bull trap as well but I think any anything above the bottom of this candle so anything around anything above the 8600 level I think is still bullish in my opinion and something to buy and to stay long with okay so that's the report for this week hopefully you enjoyed it I'll have a midweek update at some point Wednesday evening or Thursday have a great week and all the best to you
