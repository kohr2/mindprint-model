Hey good morning Fintech members it's Bob Lucas it is Thursday morning here in New York around 11 a.m. doing a midweek update on the markets here so let's start with gold kind of a little bit of a confusing count still I mean overall clearly we still have a downtrend in play but that cycle on the weekly level is extremely stretched I've talked about that numerous times hard to how to set analysis on a cycle that is just so extended to a record level but what is clear is that we still have a step down from a highs standpoint and also mostly from a low standpoint as well meaning that we are still in a declining phase as far as I'm concerned even though it kind of at one point here broke this trend line the highs are still lower so until we get back above this May 14th high around about the 1304 1305 level I really got to assume that we're still on a downtrend what's interesting is that we're on day 20 today so we are looking for a DCL at some point soon the day eight top makes this left translated so I'm thinking because of that we are going to see maybe one more final decline to really shake out whoever's left in this market I mean it hasn't really if you consider that the top was in February or February 20th so we're looking at more than three months now since the last investor cycle top it hasn't declined much at all it's only down around 50 or 60 dollars so it has been mostly a sideways consolidation on the weekly chart it looks more like a like a flag than anything else but based on the effect they were on day 20 and we've not seen a failed cycle I do want to see or do think we may see one more decline I don't know how deep that decline might be could be down to 12 40 issues or so to end the daily and finally after such a long period of time and the weekly cycle as well yeah so here it is quickly on the weekly chart being a decent decline now very long cycle here I mean the last cycle low was back in August we're already in almost June talking about almost a year I have talked about the idea that this is just one big yearly cycle with no clear-cut investor cycle at the 26 week average level if that's the case we don't get a low until kind of the the August time frame which is another 10 or eight weeks away from here that's also a possibility that we have to look out for but for now we really have not broken at least I mean depending on where you draw this but in any event we have not broken kind of the the downtrend since the drop in February and we still are right at the 10-week moving average I think we're just above it today with the four or five dollar increase in gold's price actually it's up around seven dollars now as I as I as I write as I speak it was when I started this video only up around four dollars so it's jumped four dollars in the last four or five minutes I'm not sure what's going on specifically yet um let's see how the week closes I think it can close below the 10-week moving average then the decline is still in play um the indicators are telling me though that we could have an ICO anytime and obviously timing wise we are due um we have some iris RSI divergence here looking higher so we could move higher if we break higher from this point then I think we are and going back to the daily we're seeing this candle now come up as I record I think if we come up and rally higher so if we do something like this let me draw in red so you can get a better feel for it if I can find the color let's just draw in green oh here it is okay so if we do this then I think obviously that we have a higher high this becomes an ID CL somewhere right in here not a not a price low so that would be bullish and then I think we can go up and test the 13 60 13 70 area still a lot of work to be done even though this is looking really good today we're at kind of one or two week highs at the moment with this this move higher keeping an eye on them and I was going to talk about GDX possibly breaking down and when I was looking at this about half an hour ago it was right at the bottom of this line here now it's rallying up with gold's move in the last sort of 10 minutes so I'm not sure what's going on here but if if gold is still looking for that final DCL decline and ICL then I expect the miners to drop out of this pattern here and form a deeper lower maybe the 19 dollar area before going higher a lot that's got to do with what the market is doing right now at this moment GDX is up around 24 cents or 1% in the last five or six minutes but of course plenty of time left and plenty of room left before it kind of breaks out of this this pattern here all right turning to stocks I went short one position yesterday I think stocks are done for the investor cycle I think we have a pretty unusual but we will have a day three high based on the fact that we have now a failed cycle I don't see this being kind of a day 50 or so DCL I'm pretty this looks pretty good for a DCL right here we had six or seven good training days lower we had many spikes below and then recoveries we had one two three I think this low here marks the second DCL day 42 is a good timing for that otherwise we're talking day 50 plus for here so what do we see from here potentially well I think we we see maybe some lower prices but then I think we see a recovery up to the 20 day moving average something like that and then come back down and then continuation lower that's typically how it would play out if this is the top of the investor cycle again making that the top because we have a failed cycle right here it has happened before it does happen we we do see sometimes failed cycles within an event failed daily cycles within an investor cycle and then the market goes up to new highs not very common but you know I think at I think at this point now if we go on to make a move above this day three high it would be caution for me that the cycle has not necessarily topped but again it's only the previous second daily cycle top that is of real interest here that is something that cannot be exceeded in in the scenario obviously where we think this is the top of the investor cycle that we're seeing lower prices I do think we're going to see lower prices into the summer now based on this there's a lot of headwind as well geopolitically economically seems like now a lot of the stuff's getting real and people are getting nervous the bond market is rallying sharply yields are inverting again and then the weekly cycle here for equities let's go to the next one and then the second one is the second one is the

dollar here look all i can say here is that we do have a very clear and clean pattern of cycles but we just have one nice big long trending cycle higher i think this is bullish long term short term i keep saying i think we're overdue now for the top in the weekly cycle let's go to the weekly chart and here it is here um yeah i think this is a nice move but i think we're it's time for a move lower i don't know how much lower this is a leftover from last time we are due the icl it's coming i think get down back to kind of this support line here would be reasonable it's not a horrible decline i think they'll let gold kind of rally question is though is this sort of a rising wedge that gets broken down um or is it more of a sort of a running a running pattern that breaks up and sharply higher of course we're gonna have to wait and see just don't know um and yeah i mean just a wait and see game for the dollar i think overall the takeaway is that it's strong uh you look at the last two so it's one two this is the third investor cycle since the early february low it's been mostly higher um and there's plenty of reasons to think they could go higher based on kind of the trade wars and everything else that's going on there's a strong bid behind the dollar because of that okay so that's the week midweek update i'll have a weekend report out as usual thank you very much
