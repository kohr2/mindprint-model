Well, good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas, Friday morning in New York. I hope you're all doing really well. Have a very exciting lightning report to give you today. I think it's going to be a long video. Just be warned. Although I will mark down all the coins I'm reviewing in the comment section below with a timestamp for you to be able to kind of breeze through it and go to the coins that you're most interested in. I will, of course, as always start with a Bitcoin wrap up and look at the cycle for Bitcoin, where we're heading perhaps. Then I'll get into each of the coins. Just a bit of a caveat or a bit of a disclaimer. You know my bread and butter trading is cycles. My bread and butter is kind of Bitcoin and the major altcoins because that's where the cycle really, you know, obviously the cycle was with Bitcoin. So that's what I'm trading primarily in terms of size, in my positions and my leverage. The altcoins are me just looking at a chart. Some of these today that I'm going to look at, I'm looking at them for the first time. Be aware of that. I'm going to give, in some cases, a five second nothing here or I'm going to give some analysis on the fly, okay, for the very first time. So just take that with a grain of salt in some respects because, you know, I'm just giving you my passing view on this. I may not, you know, may not be trading that. I'm just going to give you just a quick view of what I think. Okay, so that said, let's get into it. Start with Bitcoin. All right, so Bitcoin here actually is not looking so bad. Day 18 high. I think we have, well, comfortably have a cycle, a mid or half cycle low that occurred three days ago. And it seems like here that we're looking to sort of rally from this point, maybe go up. Now here's the big question mark. And I mentioned this in the last couple of videos. The question is, where does the top for this cycle form? If it formed right here on day 18, then that's not necessarily a good sign, right? It's left translated. It occurs left of the midpoint, does not exceed the prior cycle, does not create this higher high scenario that we're looking for. And then what that would mean is we'll probably get something more like this occur. And if that occurs, there's plenty of time left in the cycle. Another 30 days, in fact, because we're on day 30 of 60 day cycle. There's plenty of time, a whole month at this point for Bitcoin to really get in trouble, right? And the prior lows, the prior cycle lows, the last two, are not that far below. I mean, the February low is only $500 below and $600 to $700 for the actual bear market low. You know, Bitcoin can take, look at this candle here and this candle here and these candles, right? Bitcoin can drop four to $500 in a 24 hour period. So there would be concern if we do not exceed the day 18 high because we get this scenario and then there's plenty of time to do all sorts of sort of crazy things with Bitcoin. And that would be my concern, right? There's room below and time for this to cause damage and for this December low to finally give way. Now, if we, that's the bearish case. If we can though rally from this point and it's looking kind of positive the way, the way this chart's forming are now, if we can kind of rally at this point and get up and exceed the day 18 high, then we have a right translated cycle. We have a higher high. So this, this day 18, sorry, arrow goes away, right? It's an irrelevant number at that point from a cycle standpoint or mostly irrelevant, irrelevant, irrelevant, relative. Jeez. Um, the day nine high from the last cycle was exceeded. And then we have that high. So we have the higher low and a higher high and the makings of a new uptrend, right? So then we can probably do something like this, right? Big shake out into the April cycle low. But at that point, what, what do we have? Let's zoom out. So if we have this red bullish scenario, we're a right translated cycle. Let's just draw in red day 30 today. So let's just draw this in here. Okay. Let's have midpoint right there. Uh, this becomes the cycle high at that point. This becomes like a, you know, like a day 47 or something like that. Just throwing a number out there that becomes a right translated cycle. So the midpoint, the last low to this low, the, the high comes well past the midpoint. Uh, we get rid of this and then we have a situation where we have one higher low, two higher high, three, again, using the word, perhaps a higher low. That's the trend change that puts this December low into focus for being the bear market low, the four year cycle. So then what this allows for going forward is this trend change, this new uptrend and start to build and extend this base that we have. So we can rally from this point, uh, start to rally up, and then we can even go up to match the $6,000 area, which was the base of that descending triangle from all of 2018. That would provide a lot of resistance, but we can then make a move over the spring months, test that area, come back down and then, you know, sort of form that next cycle low in June, but at a much higher place and, you know, probably somewhere definitely above this first cycle high that we had. Let's just draw that out like that. So that 4,200 area, the two sort of peaks here would become support, but maybe even above this line as well. So that's also a possibility where we do something like this. Okay. Let's just draw that across and then this cycle low form something like that. Okay. So you're starting to see now this step up, step up, step up process where Bitcoin is forming higher highs and higher lows. And then, you know, that could probably bounce up for maybe even six months at this point up against a $6,000 level, which was that huge, um, you know, huge support before it, it was given, you know, before it gave way back in 2018, that's going to provide some resistance, but still point is that we get out of the kind of the gutter that we're in right here, the base and come up and step up to the next big level. But again, a lot of this also depends on what happens in the next five or 10 days. If we don't exceed this day nine candle, we don't have that new series of higher highs. And that puts, you know, puts this base, this bear market base in jeopardy, this sideways chopping motion. And actually I've been talking about, we do need to, at some point prove that we can step up and make a new higher high. So I'm looking at that really close at the moment. Uh, I'm encouraged, uh, you know, I'm long right now with a very tight stop, um, looking for a move at least back to just, just for the half cycle, at least back to sort of 41 50. But I think we can also break out a little bit and get up, maybe even up to sort of 45, 46 possibility. Okay. Um, let the market play out at this point. Okay. So now we're going to go into the lightning round. They are going to be, they're going to be alphabetically because my list is sorted right now. Alphabetically. I'm just going to go through, start picking them out, give you some quick views on each of these. So we're going to start with ADA Cardano. Uh, so this one here, I have, I have an alert sitting on this trend line. Uh, I do like the inverse head and shoulders pattern. The neckline is here. That's ultimately where you'd want to be sort of long, long with size, but I do notice here that the recent drop, uh, managed to stay below the bottom shoulder here. That's a good sign. We're starting to develop more of a complex, uh, or more, more of a deeper shoulder here. Um, I think here, if this can hold this area and start to move higher again, break this red line, it could, it could mean going long with a stop at the lows right here. Uh, and then going long again with a more size kind of on this, uh, on this neckline right here. Okay. Um, so that's what I like about Cardano. I think this looks pretty good overall. Looking at arc here, this has got, it has a really huge spike. I mean, that's just massive 2300. There mustn't be much, a lot of volume in this, but I do like the basing pattern. This also has that, uh, inverse head and shoulders. Look about it. It broke the neckline. It's already out. It, it retested the neckline perfectly. It launched higher. It's come all the way back down. You would think if this is going to continue higher, it's going to do it fairly soon. So this here, uh, this is not for me. It's not my type of trade at the moment. I don't know anything about this, but I know some people have asked about it. Uh, this has potential here, a lot of potential for going and continuing higher. You stop with definitely at a worst case be the lows here on February 16th. Okay. So if you're going to do anything with that kind of like, look at that, it's still quiet, not that far below. It's around a 1250 trading of 14, uh, 1400 to Toshi right now. So, um, that's, that's a spot you can possibly getting long around here. It's sort of clustering here. I could, can break up higher, uh, not a beautiful pattern, but, uh, it does, it has at least broken out of the inverse head and shoulders. So it has the potential to continue higher at this point. And we've seen by these wicks that there's, uh, the potential to push this much higher. Another request, air swap, AST. This chart looks pretty good. Um, nice space, uh, December low, February, February higher low. Um, nice move up here turning again today. This could be a long trade right here. Look at that. Uh, I would say play it nice and, nice and tight. Your stops are right here, uh, at around about eight, eight 79. So, you know, tired enough at least I like this pattern. I think this is a buy Bitcoin cash is looking fairly weak. Um, I did look for a breakout. Uh, didn't, it didn't happen here. It came back down, still trending sideways, unless it breaks this new trend line I've drawn. Um, no real interest here. If anything, this could break lower as far as I'm concerned. Bitcoin cash looks the same as Bitcoin. Sorry. Bitcoin SV looks the same as Bitcoin cash. Apologize about that. Um, nice, pretty flat, uh, nothing really going on here. I, I, I mean, this is going to pump at one point, but it's not looking like it's going to do that now. Binance, what a run looking parabolic for sure. Um, starting in December at the 1200. So at 12,000 level up to 40,000, that's, you know, three X move, um, structure of this definitely looks like it's, uh, you know, going parabolic. I think it might've topped here pretty big reversal candle, but you know what? It's still well above, uh, sort of a 10 day moving average still probably outside of the Bollinger bands. Let me see if I can enable that. Yeah. It's just coming back into the Bollinger bands. It hasn't collapsed yet. If you're long and treating it, you can stay long here. Um, but at some point, you know, this is going to come all the way back down, probably come back into this cluster at some point, which is a sizable decline. Um, but certainly it's going to come back. But the question is when can it go higher? And of course, anything in a parabolic type state can always go higher. So, uh, ENJ engine coin, wow. This, this thing is unreal. I have, this was actually probably like the third or fourth largest altcoin holding of mine. I just dumped around two thirds of it this morning on the market. Um, this is just, it's just too much for me to ignore, you know, coming up from a, what's that, uh, below 950 to 5,000, a five X move in 10 training days. I mean, that's great, right? It's, it's, it's good if you're holding it, but, um, for me, I mean, it's too late to trade. So if you're trading this, I would get out. This is, this is enough. Um, this is rallied way too much. I think this comes crashing back down to kind of the 2000 area, and then it can, it's maybe to rebuy if you, if you want to go long and you like it longterm from a trade, uh, this, this looks like it's, it's run its course perhaps. Um, but yeah, I mean, this just looks great. Uh, I think from a longterm perspective, I also like this one a lot. Um, but again, yeah, this is just run its course. I would be taking profit at this for sure. Somebody asked about civic coin. Um, this is, um, not looking like anything special kind of around the bottom. We had a low low in February. Don't really like too much about this. Now, of course, if the old coin space across the board takes off this, this will go up as well, but in general, nothing, nothing exciting to report here. EOS looks pretty good. In fact, um, I have a trend line here from the other day. It did a bounce. It's looks like it could be going higher again. It's, it's kind of come out of this basing pattern, this inverse head and shoulders pattern. Um, I like this. I'm going to remove that. I think if you go long or if you are long, if you are long, stay long, if you want to go long, you could, uh, the stop would be this bottom candle here. 8,000 for eight, four, two, zero is kind of your stop. Um, I like this shot. This looks pretty good to me. I think EOS has turned the corner. It has put in a pretty long, pretty wide base. And I think this could do something like that and continue higher. So, yep, I definitely like EOS at this point. Well, Ethereum looks like it has a sort of bear market low in place. I've talked about the December low sort of sticking higher low here, but it hasn't really done much since. Um, so just curious to see what this is up about. Uh, I think it, it wants to go higher, but it's, um, yeah, it's just not really responding like I would have hoped. Uh, I, I'm not taking a long trade on this, but if you were long, your stop is probably this candle right here. Obviously the prior cycle low is also a point to be out a hundred percent, but yeah, there's no real, um, nothing really exciting about this chart that wants me to, to jump on this. Some of the altcoins I've shown already seem to have much more promise than what Ethereum is showing right now. Next up is icon ICX. I'm long this. I did an alert on this. It's, uh, looking still constructive at this point. Uh, it's up around, uh, 60 Satoshi around about six or seven percent since the alert, I've moved my stop up slightly up to the March seventh lows here. Um, that is a logical zoom in here. So here I don't want it. My stop was right below the March 4th, sorry, the March ninth candle, moving it up to this candle here. I want to try and get it up to kind of that break even point as fast as possible, which is around about the eight of five. I think it is. Um, yeah. So at this point still showing a potential loss on this trade, if it does reverse, but the chart looks pretty good at this point, it looks like it could rally higher and it's a type of, it's a type of coin that could probably easily make up to around this sort of 11,000 area. So my goal for this, because I'm going to spend a little more time on this because it is a trade. Uh, my goal here would be to get to break even as quick as possible and then look for a sort of a 10% move up to around about maybe the night or actually the peak of this candle today would have been 10%, but look at around about 920, 930, take some profit, and then maybe let the rest ride up to around about the 1100 area for potential profit. So that's what I'm looking at for icon. Another member request from the comment section with self key. I know nothing about this project or this coin first time looking at this chart and I'm not impressed. We have not only do we not have sort of the February cycle low as, uh, as the low, right? We wanted December low to be below because that's, that shows us a higher low, but we have fresh lows in March and that's not good. So this for me is a sell. This is not a good looking chart. Of course it could always rally up, but from what I see here, it just shows relative weakness and I'm not interested in something like that. Now LISC is also showing a February low, not a March low, uh, but at least it seems like it's turning up. So, uh, this one has the potential to surprise. I'm not sure if anybody's really talking too much about it right now. Let's see if we can kind of, yeah, it's, I mean, it's not really, it's not really a nice clean, uh, pattern or anything like that, but it seems like it may want to be, may want to pop out here. Uh, it looks like it might be forming kind of a, um, you know, it's formed a low and it looks like it could be rallying from here. So, uh, not something I'm particularly interested in, but this here has some potential here. If you, if you kind of know this coin, you know, the way it trades, um, you know, and you're comfortable with it, then there's an opportunity here. Of course the cluster of candles recently around the 3,100, less than a 10% move is your stop point. Um, even the 10 day moving average could be a stop point as well, make it much tighter. So this one here I'll kind of like, um, not a huge fan, but this is constructive and it looks like it might be starting to make a move higher. Of course, Litecoin is the darling, uh, at the moment making massive moves higher. Um, my experience over many, many years of trading is that when something is dramatic, dramatically outperforming everything else that's pushing the upper Bollinger bands, that is extremely overboard on the RSI and stay with it. Don't go against it. All right. So you either want to be not touching it. Um, or you want to be riding it, you don't want to be shorting it, never want to short something that's strong like this. This is a beautiful looking uptrend. It's taking out prior, uh, sort of pivots and cluster points during the down decline. Uh, nothing, nothing negative to say about this. Now, of course, you're going to get some pretty sharp pullbacks a lot. Um, and, and those are probably good buying opportunities. Like for example, now it's sort of stretched out of, from this cluster here, from this sort of flag pattern has now rallied. So it could either trade sideways for a while, it could dramatically come back to kind of the, the trend line or the mean or the 10 day moving average. And that would in theory be another, um, another point of entry as well. So this looks good overall. MKR has been on a good run and I think it's looking like it wants to go on another run here. Um, let's have a look at this. Yeah, this, this, this is looking pretty good here. I think this is consolidating all these gains. Um, it doesn't look like it's going to roll over. If it did, then you're probably looking at the lows from, uh, I think it's Monday or Tuesday right there as a stopping point. This could be a long trade or you can wait for kind of a breakout of, uh, you know, kind of this line that I've drawn here, which is sort of the top of each of the daily candles, um, loosely at least. Um, but yeah, this is, this is looking pretty good. I think this based on this strength, I like that this could be a sort of a, uh, consolidation here, some profit taking before maybe going on another run of similar sort of length. So at least something that, uh, sort of covers this length here from this breakout, seeing another one of those go up to the sort of a 0.22, 0.23 area as well. Um, we've kind of got a good reset in some of the technicals. So this looks pretty good overall. Um, I'm not sure if I would take it right now, but, um, it does look pretty good. Yeah. Ontology is a request that I had in the comments, uh, looking good. Yeah. This has got a base. This has got a December low that's lower. February low. That's kind of a double bottom. Good move higher from here. Come back down to 10 day moving average coming back up. I think this is a long, I'm not taking it, but this is a definitely a long stop is, uh, the candle from the weekend. I think it is that, um, that would be an indication if it was to go below that it's probably doing a double top. So if it did this, that's an out for sure. But you know, it's coming off a double bottom here. It's had a good move, consolidated, some profit taking and that's coming back up. I think this has potential to go much higher at this point, at least to sort of this area here. Okay. And then looking back, there's plenty of room above to go further. Raven coin. Wow. This one has become popular. A lot of requests for this. Uh, I missed it this time around, even though I had an alert set on this very trend line. Can you believe that it's just the way the way trading works? Um, I had it for the first move higher, and that was a really big, uh, profit winner for me. And I also had it posted on alerts here at Bitcoin live, but not this time, um, dramatically overbought extended, but that's how some of these, uh, breakouts and pops in the alts work. Right. But I don't know what to tell you right here. It's still above the Bollinger bands. It hit almost, uh, the 1000 Satoshi level. That was kind of the top right here as well. Even though we had this really big wick all the way up to sort of 10 50, I think it was, but Hey, this is a double top at the moment. And I'm not sure what else you'd be looking for coming out of a 250, 300 base, a three X move. That's kind of enough, right? If you're trading this, you want to be watching it really closely because um, you know, if, if you want to hold and maintain this trajectory and hold your position, you've got to give it a lot of room. A lot of room means giving up maybe 200 to 300 Satoshi just to stay in position. Good chance that if you keep doing that all the way up that you're gonna, you're gonna end up sort of selling at this 900 level, 900 level. Anyway, my, my point is that if you hold now with a 300 Satoshi sort of trailing stop, it goes up to sort of 1100 and then you're still holding that 300 Satoshi trailing stop. It's going to pull all the way back eventually to 900 and take you out of position. So if I was in a position right now, I'd be scaled out pretty, pretty significantly by this three X move here. And then looking at this candle as well, I would be potentially, I would, I would pretty much be getting out at this point, to be honest with you. I'd keep some, maybe just to keep writing it, right? Cause you want to, you want to, you want to try and maximize a move like this, but after a three X move, or even a two X move, in fact, but after three X move, it's like, Hey, take, take your profits big enough. It's way more than you expected. I'm sure if you went long, the breakout, you really weren't thinking 900 Satoshi, you were probably thinking 500 would be phenomenal. So if you've, you know, if you've managed to hold this long, kudos, right? That's a clap for you. You've done great, but probably banks and profit and move on as far as I'm concerned.
