Good morning Bitcoin Live members it's Bob Lucas May 30th in New York hope you're doing really well this is your top 10 market cap report i think it's gonna be an exciting one today we do see a lot of good movement and a lot of good setups in in the alts in the majors i should say and obviously bitcoin's had a good run but it could be time now for a bit of a switch over and a little bit of a altcoin run at least if the setups are correct and the early sort of forming breakouts are correct we could see a significant run in some of these some of these coins first of all let's take a quick look at bitcoin still looking pretty healthy to me we had somewhere in this vicinity here it's hard to tell because we have a time-based cycle low but we have a new cycle in play there's no doubt about that that i'm confident about question here is how much higher can we go it still is fairly early in the cycle and you know when we look back since february it's been an uptrend and a consistent and solid uptrend the entire time no reason even though price is up 180 off the bottom no real reason why not this could why this could not continue higher at this point obviously there's going to come a time and it may be soon but i think it's going to be um it's going to be at some point over the next couple of months there's no doubt about that in my mind that we'll get a sizable correction in bitcoin and the entire space for that matter and that sizable correction could be at least 30 percent in in you know in drawdown that's significant and if that were to come today that's a 2400 decline but still only putting bitcoin down into the low to mid six thousand dollar range so all relatively speaking a move back down to six sort of six four six five is only kind of um retracing back to the initial breakdown point in november i think that would be healthy i think that would be normal and in fact i kind of welcome something like that happening sooner rather than later because i don't want to see this move get too extended too parabolic too speculative because you know those types of markets can typically uh usher in kind of another sort of mini bear market or an end to you know to the run before it even gets going um so that's the first thing i want to point out uh looking at this development here looks like we kind of have uh you know consolidation nice little flag almost because we do have lower highs in here and somewhat lower lows that's kind of how a flag generates i think that is just consolidating this nice big bar that we had on may 26th that jumped by a thousand it's possible in my opinion that we get another such bar like this uh at some point at the end of this pulling us up to something like 97 98 maybe even 10 000 and that could be the end of this nice little five to six month rally that we've seen and could bring in a period of maybe two months or even three months even longer perhaps of just mostly downside but just chopping action as it consolidates this massive 180 or by that point over 200 move in in bitcoin i guess the point overall is you don't short a trend like this you stay with the uptrend it's still well above a 20-day moving average which is kind of a very healthy uptrend and fairly steep uptrend at that so let this market unfold i'm still long from obviously from a trading standpoint and always will be but also from a leverage standpoint i'd be wrong around the eight thousand dollars at this point um not far from the initial breakout point of around about 81 80 8200 so the the risk is getting smaller and smaller hopefully we get an upside break and then we can move so the stops to below maybe yesterday's candle here at around the 84 85 hundred area and maybe even higher than that but for now stick with the uptrend stick with what is proven stick with where price has been not where you think it might be going and that's going to probably serve you really well in the end let's look at now ethereum and some of the other top 10 coins and here's ethereum i think ethereum looks pretty good came back down took a while consolidated consolidated three really big candles and we now have a turn back above a 10-day moving average so i think we have a nice setup in play i think we could see this continue from this point and start to make some higher highs as we go along and maybe as bitcoin kind of stays flat versus the dollar we can get some of these majors start to outperform in general because it has been besides a couple of uh three or four days a few weeks back it has been for the most part a bitcoin story all the way since since bitcoin really started rallying in in february it uh we saw the top 10 kind of i mean they held their ground in general mostly at least um but they did trend lower and sideways as well at the same time there were very few besides the the specs or the alt alt coins that some of those did really well but in general the top 10 have kind of trended sideways or lower and i think it's time now for some outperformance ideally we'd like to see bitcoin move higher against the dollar uh not rapidly but just in a consistent nice manner and then we see these top 10 coins really outperform outperform bitcoin as well that would be ideal and i think it's possible at this point but for now i'm definitely long ethereum i like this chart i think we can see a move back up to 0.36 and then even eventually 0.4 i kind of test this top here that we had in january and then beyond that i think it can go higher but um you know let's take it one step at a time of course i think now constructively this chart looks really good and i want to be long this chart all right xrp i got out of this one when it crossed down below a 20-day moving average and now has reversed so i'm starting to like this chart again um it's looking more positive it's back above the 10 20-day moving average we've got the 10-day coming back up again i think i'm going to enter into another long position here there's a lot of interest on the social media for this a lot of people getting on board so i think there's momentum there to and the ecosystem is going to push this higher and i think it looks like this downtrend that began back in december here and accelerated from april down into this may low which coincides with this september low is now probably going to be a double bottom here and now we have sort of a i wouldn't call it a retest but a retrace at least and now i think we're going to start moving high so a lot of upside potential in this this has kind of the making of a 60 70 move so i'm not you know not in a huge hurry here and i but i think if we do get long right now we are looking at just uh this this point here as the stop on may 26th that provides a nice stop loss could even move that slightly higher but you know you get some of these wicks that take you out so that's a probably a good spot um so i will be going in long on on ripple here as well all right moving on to bitcoin cash looking decent as well although you know what what what i don't like about this is it hasn't really outperformed at all shown any real um any real interesting in going higher against bitcoin maybe i'm a little biased towards bitcoin abc and and sv in a negative way at least um just because of my allegiance overall to bitcoin itself but we're trading here and we're not uh not necessarily investing i think basically if the top 10 coins are going to go higher this one is probably going to catch a bit as well although if you do recall bitcoin cash kind of moves on its own a lot and we've seen in the past where the top 10 or the majors have really rallied and this has stayed kind of flat and then eventually this has its own day and then you've got this this three to five day kind of spike and it catches up the entire gain in three four days it's done it here and did it here as well but it also used to do it before the fork before the bitcoin sv fork you'd see that quite a bit so it's possible that this one chops and chops and chops and then the rest of the majors do well and then then this one has its day so i'm not long this one um it's a decent looking chart you could go along here i think your stop would be right as it's marked here so it's pretty tight it's a decent stop right below the sort of may 27th lows and the bollinger bands are getting a little tighter here as well so we could be looking at a move see how the boulder bands got tight here and they moved um could be looking at that move but again it's not for me so i'm not on this but it's not a horrible looking chart and again there's a good sort of downside risk protection here so the the reward is probably up to maybe in this area here and then your risk is fairly small so it's kind of three to one or four to one as well so that's not too bad eos looks really good as well this this is now this has a clean bottom uh other charts had this downtrend retest uh or retrace and then back up this has already had its move i think this continues higher from here there's no no doubt if the mate is going to catch a bit then this one is going to go higher it had a good solid run off the bottom in december so i like this chart the only reason why i'm probably not going long right now is i just want long ripple i'm long ethereum and i'm long litecoin so they're all majors and they all have similar setups similar chart looking patterns there's a limit to how many of these i can get into because they're highly correlated right now if one of them is going to fail they're probably all going to fail so then here i am setting my risk at kind of one percent of capital per trade all of a sudden i have three percent out there risk adding another one here becomes four and five percent risk because they're also highly correlated they all have similar charts it stands to reason that if these fail to materialize then um you know you're going to get a multiple stop out loss and for litecoin another similar setup here all look pretty much the same again downturn retrace break out now looking you know 10 10 day crossed above a 20 day looking now to start making a new series of higher highs and higher lows litecoin i like because it was very consistent in the uptrend from november so i took a position in this uh already and looking for a move up to this sort of area here and then if if that trend can stick we're looking at higher highs all the way up we also have the litecoin halving coming up very rapidly i think it's only like 80 something days away even though some of that i think is what this is about here i think we get one more run leading up to it or close to it and then we get kind of a dump after the fact or you know a dump dump on the news type of deal still plenty of time before that and i like this chart so long on litecoin binance coin obviously is still doing really well and i don't want to discount binance i like this from a long-term standpoint they're doing a lot of things right at the moment but uh i think the other the other coins the other top 10 coins offer a better short-term trading opportunity the setup is cleaner and clearer not to say that this could not go on and make new highs i wouldn't be surprised but from a chart standpoint um you know i still don't see a lot here uh that i'm excited about it is sort of in this consolidation in this range the last high fell short of the previous high and then we have a lower low here as well so at the moment the trend here as far as i'm concerned is slightly to the downside you see that here and then if i draw another one in here you also see that you've kind of got a few lower lows sort of here so overall this is not um something i can see as a short term trade setup again i like the other the other coins i already have positions in much more than this so i would avoid this one all right xlm you know this is one here where i wouldn't be surprised if we get a huge or a significant move up at this point but it's also the weakest of the lot having made all-time lows just recently i think again this does look correlated to the other majors that i covered similar structure um still has not broken the trend line though but it has a similar structure where it's downtrend back to a retrace but still hasn't really moved so this is a few steps behind some of the other majors but i think if those majors continue higher than this will as well so there's a chance here you can take a trade i'm not taking it but what i do like is that there's a very tight stop capability offered here right here on the lows on may 26. so you know this could be one of those ones where you take a small position let me zoom in take a small position thinking that if the rest of the alts or the majors sorry go higher then this one's also going to break out of that pattern and make a move higher it gives you a decent risk reward opportunity because the risk here is pretty tight at less than sort of 10 here on that so something to consider but again i don't really like it for the reasons i mentioned i'm sticking with my other three long positions for now because i think if this one does well stellar i'm pretty sure that the other ones will do well as well but i'm not certain if litecoin and ripple and ethereum do well i'm not convinced that this one will so that's why i want to stick with the stronger name even though this chart looks good as well ada again is the exact same setup we have the downtrend we have the retrace and now we have the move higher nice bar today i think this goes higher again highly correlated to the other open positions if they do well this will do well and vice versa so it's really pick your poison which one gives you the best risk reward perhaps this one has a good reward here this one could also make a good 60 70 percent rally before looking to turn lower risk is pretty well defined right here again may 26 candle is important could go a little tighter as well but i think it's not worth it but you could go to the bottom of the may 28th candle again correlated pick pick which one you like um in in these majors to go long okay and lastly tron tron's a little different than the rest it doesn't have well it has somewhat of a similar structure recently but the longer term picture is kind of different here we had a nice big breakout from a base very significant rally completely retraced all of that move i think that's done now this this decline is done it's back into kind of that original channel it found the bottom it retraced it didn't go below and now have a nice swing i think this is going to become a good candidate but i'm not sure if it's ready just yet but even taking a small position perhaps and and for for a longer term hold is also an option for many of you because it does offer pretty big upside potential as well and it has gone you know it has gone uh you know three to four hundred percent higher from this area i think this is a good area to establish a longer term hold and position for from a trade again i think i like my existing three long positions uh again adding to this is probably not as highly correlated but it is correlated because you can see the structure as it is here may 26 kind of bottom um retrace i should say and then you know the may the may 13th bottom similar again has not broken out yet so this one is also lagging slightly i think this would do well if the rest of them do well same story but again it's just a matter of which ones you like which ones you think you have a better handle on which chart patterns or which of these have been trading similarly to the way you like uh you know the way you where you like price to unfold i guess is what i'm saying pick the one you you feel gives you the best chance to read and trade all right so let's look at the market cap to end so yeah look at this as i said a few weeks ago or last week i think i said uh here's the pennant here's the breakout all looking really good the whole sector is moving higher um we have kind of this breakout point here let's see if i can kind of draw this in a little bit right then we had another consolidation here a rally pennant rally still in that rally phase and a lot of this has to do with bitcoin going higher of course it's it's it's pulling up the market cap of everything else because everything else is staying um pretty relatively strong or relatively at least um you know consistent with bitcoin and bitcoin going up it's bragging it's dragging up the market cap um but yeah we know from the past market cap can go into the uh into the sort of 400 million plus area so plenty of time plenty of room here be patient take the setups as they unfold and i think you'll do fine that's the wrap if you have any questions as always leave them below i'll be happy to to discuss and then let's look for the lightning report probably tomorrow maybe even over the weekend take care and all the best
