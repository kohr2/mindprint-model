Good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas Friday morning in New York, May 17th. I hope you're doing really well. this is your weekly lightning report covering some of the altcoins made by request from members, gonna cover, I think, around about 13 or 14 coins that were listed in the comment section. before I do that, of course, let's go over Bitcoin, as we always do take a look at what could be going on and we do have some significant action overnight. Bitstamp in particular was an exchange that looks like dropped considerably from the rumor it was a fat finger trade. I'd never buy fat finger trades. in any event, it has pushed the entire market down. all the exchanges- not to this extent on this chart, but all the exchanges are down and into the $6,000 range, which, if you look at it from the peak not too long ago at 8400, is a very sizable decline already. first point I want to make for those hodlers out there, people who want to get a long-term position and hold that position and not look back. you're going to run out of excuses here over the next day or maybe week. your price, your limit order, should be in at whatever level you're comfortable at, but even at the 64 or 6500 area. that's $2,000 off the top. that was reached a couple of times here last week and and earlier this week. I'm not sure what you'd be waiting for beyond that. I think trying to get a lower price, sort of below 6400, is getting a little too greedy, and the market could definitely leave you behind in that case. so that's just the first thing. second thing I want to say is: this is a four-hour chart. looks to me now that we definitely have a top in place and we're now sort of rolling over. obviously, here we had this Bitstamp low print down to 6180 or so. I think the market probably wants to come down into that area, although I'm not convinced it wants. it wants to or could go much lower than that. the one thing that we do have, though, is a cycle top. let me go back to a daily chart. so it looks almost certain now that we have a day 52 high. that was overdue, but expected. at the same time, markets recovering a little bit here, and it could recover all the way back to 76- 7700. cycle lows and cycle declines are a process. they take time. be aware of that. we may get, over the next day, kind of almost a retest down to this area, but then don't be surprised if we kind of get this move back up even. it may even happen today or tomorrow actually, but I'm just I'm just kind of outlining a possible scenario and then then sort of roll over and then kind of come down to this final cycle low error again, predicting where price ends up in a cycle low is very difficult to do. we're looking at time more than anything else and being on day 52, even even this chart- a little too aggressive from a time standpoint- should be probably shorter than that. excuse me, I'm losing my voice a little bit here. let's just draw this in kind of like this: okay, it is only it is may 17th already. I'm kind of getting ahead of myself here in terms of time. this is going to be much tighter because we are on day 52, kind of want to draw in a cycle low much sooner. so even that's probably too late. that's june 5th, that's another 12 or 13 days away. looking more for a cycle low towards the end of this month, although we did have two cycle lows that were kind of earlier than the 60 days. we had one seven days early and 13 days early, so we could easily get one that's 10 days late at this point and that does put us in towards the end of the month. my point overall is that we do have a lot of price here to consolidate, a lot of profit taking to occur now that we have what looks like a top in place. generally it takes a little bit more, a little more time, a little longer than you think, to consolidate gains before sort of moving up again. but from a price standpoint I don't know, I really don't. I think I don't. I want to draw back here to this breakdown here in November and often you know, what happens is the market does not break down back below this area. and I'm not looking necessarily at these lows in the sort of 5800 area. I'm looking more at where it kind of started breaking down and that may be the extent of it. so 6400 or maybe even this low on bit stamp might be it from a price standpoint. again, pro takeaway is that it's where the where does the candle end? so where is the actual low? that's something like this is probably a better idea and then continue higher again. another takeaway is that we should be in defensive mode right now. you shouldn't be leveraged long, holding your positions. long in BTC is still okay as far as I'm concerned because we are trading sort of these now uptrending cycles, but also being in USDT for the time being in trading accounts is also probably not a bad thing. I don't see this market going higher in immediate term and getting away from you. I think, like I said, we're going to chop around for a while and look for the next 60 day cycle low coming up probably by the end of this month. okay, so let's move on now into the lightning report and go over a list of the coins that we have requested by members. all right, starting off, another note here on how this works. some of these charts look horrible. I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time trying to break down a chart that just doesn't look like there is a trade to be had. again, if you like a project from a long-term standpoint, if you like the technology, if you think it's going somewhere, that's kind of on you and your own analysis on when you need to buy. I'm going to give you more of a trader's view on the chart and give you an idea of what I see, and the first example that somebody asked for was FTC or Feathercoin, and this one here does not interest me in any way. we have new lows right here in May. if anything is is attractive, it should be nowhere near new lows. it should be have some good separation between, say, the December lows or February lows, and this one does not have anything like that. and really this is just a big one, big downtrend with a lot of price history to be had here. so for me this is kind of like a dead coin or dead project. there really isn't any interest from anybody to drive this higher, so for me this is an avoid at all cost. all right, Qtum was a project actually I do have. I have a position in this one long term only because I have a small position in all those kind of dApp platform type of solutions in case they end up unseeding Ethereum, nothing significant. but this one was looking good. actually a couple months ago- remember remember talking a lot about this one, possibly following what ADA did on the upside it seemed like it was a couple of weeks behind, but of course it did not do that. it was looking like a nice big base at one point, but now if you look at this, it has really broken below that and again, just like Feathercoin, anything that's making new lows to me- even though if all the alts could get going, this also would get going- it's not the one I want to be looking at as a leading candidate because it is making new lows. so for me, I think there are just other opportunities out there, and something like Qtum is not anything on my radar for the time being. maybe in a subsequent altcoin sort of rally it would be one that we could look at, but for now, the chart's telling me to avoid and go find something that has a lot more strength. all right, basic attention: token bat is a project actually, I think, has, you know, some has some chance. I actually don't mind. I like the brave browser. I think it's very good, not as sold on the need for the bat token, but then again, from a payment standpoint. you know, the bitcoin protocol is not necessarily there yet. lighting may change all that, but for now, the the bat project is decent, has good following, and the chart itself, though, is not showing me a whole lot. I do have an alert set in this one, because I do like to trade this. what I do like about this is that had this really nice triangle here and it held up in against bitcoin. the entire bear market held its value really nicely and it does have this very distinct sort of wave structure as we see here, and in theory we now should be completing another one of those. if you look at the timing bands on those time frames- I haven't really measured them out, but it looks like here we have kind of some nice repeatable cycles and we could be looking at a low here. so this one would be on my radar. for the person that asked, it's not a trade right now. let's try and zoom in a little bit here. so it's not a trade right now, but looks like we have almost the makings of a swing. perhaps we do have some relative strength starting to build in here. at the 10-day moving average, I think, if we can cross up, start to swing higher. I'm not sure where that number is, but maybe even something like: see these two candles here. that's a little high up. it's giving up a lot of the reversal if it does swing, but not a whole lot. again, you know these these are kind of double candidates. so when you're looking at assets that can potentially double, giving up 20 or 30 percent of the first move. to be assured that you have an uptrend is not a bad strategy, but maybe we can find another spot a little lower to confirm, but at the moment still looking for a break of this trend line, looking for maybe the 20-day moving average should be taken out and then gets get excited about something like this. so I think, put this one on the watch list and this is something you want to be. you know, looking at closely, ZRX is another example of weakness. it has really been weak for a very long time. this was and is a long-term holding of mine, not a huge one, but significant enough where it's kind of frustrating. don't know about this, thinking of looking a little deeper into it, maybe cutting my position altogether, my long-term position, and just going to BTC for for this trade, for this, this position. but from a trade standpoint I still don't see anything I like. if you really consider this chart with an unbiased manner, you see the May top here has only, has only resulted in lower lows and lower highs all the way through, and that hasn't stopped taking out this pretty important March low here, and now it looks like it wants to continue low all the way down to the December bull market top lows, where Bitcoin was really surging and the alts sort of went, went lower as a result. looks like that's the next logical point. probably we'll find some support there and then maybe it becomes a trade. but for now, this is again another example of don't look for. don't look for a trade in some of the weaker or weakest names in the list: um, hot 18, satoshi, yeah, I don't know. um could be. uh, coming to an end to this move. coming back into this 15 or 12 cluster, I think it has more downside left. um, it's still below the 10 and 20 day moving average. it is still forming lower lows. um, maybe the only time I would consider something is breaking below this pretty clear trend line. here. I got one, two, almost one here, three kind of touches of that, of that point, of that line, which is significant, but again downtrend, riding the lower bollinger bands. this is weak. you have a cluster right here. so maybe, coming back to this point, get you- excuse me, get you a little excited if it can, of course, hit that point and swing, you know, just buy because it hit that point. you want to see confirmation. and here's another one. so this is a, this is a 50 decline, uh, to this level and then probably like a 40 decline to this level. so a lot of room left here. this is not something I want to be chasing or playing. this to me is just pure kind of like penny stock type training and uh, my penny stock training is, uh is kind of like 20 years done. uh, I did that in the 90s. that's uh not something I want to be doing anymore. okay, IOST. this one's a little better. I mean, we had a nice uptrend since listing December, so around five, six months, pretty nice uptrend: 100, what's that? 112, 115, satoshi, up to 360. that's a. that's kind of like a 200x move, nice. but ever since then broke down, smashed right through, kind of this. well, that's not really not a trend line. that was just a mean line that I drew. but even if you kind of draw it sort of to the bottom there and, uh, try and fix that, you have a good breakdown. so this is again like the other ones. they're in decline, um, but if it does reverse out and show clear signs of a sort of a trend change, this could be one you can buy because it does have a decent amount of strength, recent strength and relative strength, it's not anywhere near its lows. the December lows are down at 111. it's at 160 right now, so it could be, could be looking to form a low pretty soon. maybe it's pretty kind of a an alert at this level here. not that I'm necessarily too keen on this one or excited about it, but I like to put alerts in on charts and then, when they hit, take, take another look and see if there's anything I like about it. but until that line gets crossed again with my strategy I don't try and pick bottoms in a severely declining market like this. uh, I will try and pick bottoms in a nice uptrending market. so, for example, as it was going higher, maybe try and pick a bottom somewhere around here, and then of course you would have gotten stopped out. but like picking these bottoms here, like to do that in an uptrend until you're sort of wrong. so for now, not much else to talk about in this one. just wait for a reversal. Ravencoin, which is a popular coin and has shown an ability to- um, you know, to- to lead the market in some ways, or at least lead many of the altcoins, and it had a really nice run into March. so what I like about this one is that it should, or could, continue sort of moving higher again once the altcoin space catches more of a bid, obviously now still in a bit of a downtrend, although showing signs here of a possible uh turn in the market again. not enough, though, for me to to feel comfortable that the market has turned. so let's put in another alert on this one, again looking for trend line breaks that tell me that we have a change in trend and a reversal in trend. let's put that there. okay, let me do that in a minute. um, what else do we have here? we have. so this is kind of kind of like a cup here and a blowout. um, so this area here is probably probably somewhat significant. I know we sort of just backed up against that, so again, could be looking at a low right here, um, looking for evidence that it's going to break higher, and then this one would be sort of on the top of the watch list for potential candidates for long trades. but again, you know what's important here is, if you look at all these charts, they all look very similar. some show more relative strength than the others. some are at new lows for the bear market or for, you know, the last year as a period, those ones you want to avoid. but in general they all have something very similar. they had a decent run earlier this year. they've all come back considerably and now people are sort of forcing the forcing the issue here, looking for trades when they're really not there and I think they're going to gain, they're getting stopped out. or they're just looking at btc go higher and then they're. you know they're losing uh relative to bcc. so again, just a matter of being patient here. I haven't taken really an altcoin trade, except for the ethereum one, uh yesterday or day before, and then the ripple one. those really were the first two trades I've taken in in about six weeks or seven weeks on the altcoin space because again, these charts just don't look, don't look good. and that saved me quite a bit of capital just waiting on the sidelines for good positions. and I'm not. I'm not going to change that strategy right now only because we've had a long sell-off. a lot of people look at these and say, well, they've been sold for so long, it's now value time, it's now ready. it just doesn't work that way with these altcoins. they can stay oversold and relatively weak for a very long period of time and I'm talking about many months. so even though this has been- let's look at this kind of since- uh, this one in particular is march, summer, early april, but they've been about a month and a half or six, let's just say six weeks lower. it can go to eight weeks or ten weeks lower. there's nothing stopping these alts from continuing lower. so I don't want to be caught um on the wrong side every time trying to pick a bottom. it's just just ends up adding up and adding up. every time you get stopped out and stopped down trying to find a low. so for now, avoid and just look for these, these reversals and confirmation that we have a reversal. I think if we do get a good breakout in some of these, then that will actually mean that the lows are in and we can take a higher probability shot at a new move to the upside. I had a request for Matic. I don't know anything about. this looks newly listed, at least on Binance um, well, I mean, look it's. it's definitely overbought short term. but there's just not enough history for me to um to go on. if um and it's down, it's up from sort of 50 satoshi. so it's already sort of, you know, tripled at this point. these types of charts, I mean they don't. I don't really have an edge. to be honest with you, this is very, very speculative and for me, um, you know, if I was long, I wouldn't be getting in at this point. that's the first observation I can make. second observation is: if you're kind of involved in this early on and you have a very strong position in terms of getting in sort of in this bottom area here, then they'll probably just hold it and just keep. you know, keep maybe a trailing stop lower, maybe use this 90 level, 102 maybe, or even like 126.. you're playing with really wide stops here because you got this huge swings, but this is a type of type of chart that you know could be at 300 tomorrow, the day after, and I wouldn't be surprised. so this really isn't the my type of thing and really, in general, you should be only allocating very, very small amounts to to coins like this one. yeah, BitTorrent is is almost like a penny stock as well. as far as I'm concerned. this is the type of thing that once it moves, it's going to double or triple, but you know where is that move coming from. there's like billions of these tokens out there: um, 11 satoshi, it can go to eight, six, where it's actually been to nine. it's a downtrend and it's a clear downtrend. at some point, uh, i'm pretty sure, justin and tron, and that they're going to pump this and again or get back up to this sort of 30 level. um, this isn't, this is not a good trade as far as i'm concerned. maybe if it breaks to kind of 13 or 14, you can trade, or even even 12, maybe take a small position and see if you can get like a triple or quadruple. this is the type of one where you take a very small position but you don't cash out on the double. this is the type of thing that you're sort of aiming for: the fences it's a home run type of deal and you're looking for kind of it to go to 40, so like a 400 percent type of move or a 4x move, something like that. but again, you do that with a small position only because it can continue easily, the six and five and four. so, yeah, you know it's. it's kind of like one of those lottery plays, more than anything else. all right, engine coin: enj, one of my long-term holdings. so we had this huge forex move- 5x move- and it's been consolidating and retracing and not controlling retracing and profit taking. ever since that happened in march it's been a two-month decline. i think we may be looking at a full retracement, at least maybe to the top of all these candles here. so that would be in this area here getting close to that point. um, if it gets to that point, i would be looking to maybe add a little bit to my long-term position. uh, in the meantime i do have an alert set for a trend line break, but for now it's still kind of, uh, it would not, kind of. it is in this downtrend and until the downtrend ends, again same same philosophy as all the rest of the trades here. until we see the end to this, we have to assume that decline is still dominant and that's the dominant trend. so we don't want to, we don't be training against the dominant trend. covesting well, not too bad, but looking to form a sort of rectangle bottom here. it's not a trade as far as i'm concerned. so it gets back above this 50 000 level, which is a double from here. so it's not not a trade as far as i'm concerned and from a long-term standpoint. you want to sort of it, to break out of this bottom here. it was a very, very long decline over the last two over in 2018 could be finding bottom again- nothing i like from a trade standpoint and from an investment standpoint. you want to see it form this bottom and come higher and the reason why you're willing to give up a double right here to see this confirmation is because you've got, you know, a triple or more to get back anywhere near those highs. so if you believe in this project long term, um, you know, just wait for it. wait for it to kind of break out and start to trend higher again. yeah, neo, you know neo, i think, has had its day. personally, it obviously it did really well in the, you know, the bull market phase. it is still a fraction of what it was, it's a shadow of what it was and i don't see these type of things coming back. there are so many of these platforms, so many around, and i mean, you know, there's only really room for one or two at the most, and this is how it's day. if it was going to be the platform to succeed and survive, then you would see price up into this eight thousand or nine thousand level and it's not up there. so for that reason, the fact that we just made new lows to me is a no trade and also from a long-term standpoint, i don't want to be associated with this. again, i have a small position and again, for the reason that i want to have a small position in all those platforms, just in case one does that 10x, 10 000 x move or 10 000 move um into the next sort of big bull market in a couple years. so that's the only reason, but it's not an endorsement of the project or um, something i i expect will come out of it okay. lastly, let's look at tron. so tron, i think you know it- has a good marketing team behind it. some people actually think the tech is good and there's a lot of big developer community. i was speaking to somebody recently who said there's a huge developer community behind this, so, and they're building a lot of apps that are actually being used. i don't know how true that is necessarily, but it was um, it was somewhat encouraging to hear it is back into this area here did have a nice run early on from november. um, it did a kind of a double here. i think this has opportunity and potential, but i don't think it's quite ready yet. let's, like everything else, let's draw a trend line right there, let's um, you know, let's see if we can add an alert to this one that's considerably higher. but again, i think it has to break out of this bottom area here. let's see the 10-day moving every swing. let's see some evidence that this big declines- from january, so it's been almost, uh, four months here is over, and until, until until we see that turn, there's no point in um in sort of front running that, because the potential is that it gets down to 275 level, which is a good 30, probably like a 30 or 40 drop from here, which obviously would stop you out. so i don't see any reason why we should be getting ahead of this move. but this is something i'm definitely watching, i'm paying attention to, okay, everybody. thank you, that's the lining report. these do get tiring, i've got to be honest with you, but i enjoy doing them at the same time, and i enjoy your feedback and the fact that you actually mentioned all the coins on this report, and that's it. thank you very much. have a good day.
