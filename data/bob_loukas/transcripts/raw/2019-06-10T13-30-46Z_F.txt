Good morning Bitcoin Live members, it's Bob Lucas. It is Monday morning June the 10th. Hope you had a great weekend. This is your weekly cycles report covering the Bitcoin cycle. Looking at the daily chart, looking at a weekly chart, taking a look and see if we can have a good understanding of where we are in the current cycle and let's see what type of edge that may be able to provide. So the first thing that we'll notice here is that we had this beautiful run over the last few months beginning with what was the expectation of a decline in March into the cycle low to late March. Instead we had this really significant $1,000 candle and that just was the beginning of this beautiful run over the cycle to a day 52 high. Once we hit that day 52 high and we reversed pretty sharply, this here became a clear cut signal that the cycle had topped and of course it was overdue and it was expected. It was a beautiful run but we didn't get much of a cycle decline that gives me the confidence to say that 100% this here is a cycle low. Typically after a move of this nature you would expect also a larger price decline but also a decline over more training days not just three days as we see here. So there is a little bit of a question mark right here on whether or not this is the cycle low. But I think we have to kind of mark this as a cycle low and I think in hindsight in the future it will remain the cycle low because we have just too many days removed now for it to be part of the same cycle. If we look at 54 and then 12 and looking at 66 we're looking at around about day 75 day 76 starting to get a little too more a little too advanced in the trading days for this to be all one cycle. It doesn't mean it could not be the the scenario where this is still the one cycle is where let me get my drawing tool out here is where it really does drop below this line and forms a cycle low this week. So if we get a decline this week and we drop below this level here right this this low here then we can make the argument that we're still part of this one cycle and I think I drew the same type of scenario last week and then those go away and then we have sort of a day uh 66 high up here okay and then that makes it kind of a day 80 or so maybe day 78 cycle low right here that's a very bullish interpretation of where we stand that would then give us a good sort of 10 day consolidation but overall more of a consolidation from this may 16th high all the way through to around about june 16. So a good month even though we had a higher peak right here essentially from may 16th to june 16th there would be one big consolidation and that would be a nice setup for a trap a bear trap right here down below kind of 7 000 into the six thousand dollar range it'd be a nice almost a 30 retracement from the peak let's take a look at what that might be so yeah something like that is 25 so a good 25 decline former cycle low and then sort of rally back up and continue that really nice uptrend that we have that's the one interpretation unfortunately the other interpretation i have for you is i wouldn't call it an opposite interpretation but it certainly is a at least in the short term a much more bearish interpretation where we're looking at just a day 12 high no i don't want to do that a day 12 high right here okay we have a cycle low at 54. so then what we're looking at here is a continuation lower over the next so cycle low in may until july so around about july 15th time frame let's take that arrow from here and looking at something maybe in the 56 to 5800 area and i'm going to just draw in something like this now not horrible as well and to be honest with you this is probably a healthier kind of move because it gives us more gives gives btc more time to consolidate all those gains without giving up too much ground and then if you if you recall previous videos where i looked at the past bull market and we had 30 percent retracements and more something like 14 times in in 15 months after a move like this getting a 30 percent or more retracement from the top is not unexpected and that would be something like a 34 percent decline over a two to two and a half month period i think that sets up the bull market perfectly for a continuation higher so that's kind of what i'm looking at also so really the takeaway here is that we do have some competing views on on the cycles and that happens more often than you expect or you'd think right cycles are not this absolutely perfect tool set that are always going to be predictive and in real time right there's going to be times like one right here where we just have to wait and be patient and not force our narrative and force our viewpoint on the market and just wait for the market to at least give us some clear-cut definitions of where the cycle stands for me and i'm going to zoom in again a little more for me there really isn't a bearish sorry a bullish narrative right now until we can clear back above the candle from june 7th so from three days ago i think last friday um that took me out of my short as you recall i had a short i was using a trailing stop two days before so my stop was set at this bar right here and just peak just popped right over and just took me out slightly that's just the nature of it but it still was a profitable position but right now you'll notice the 10-day moving average has popped below the 20-day moving average so we you know we don't really see that much barely it didn't do it here hasn't done it really since kind of back in february that's telling me the short-term trend has changed that gives me that gives me reason to mark the potential for a day 12 high and that now we have a cycle that's in decline that will fail meaning it'll drop below the previous low that was marked right here at may 18th so um there isn't a bullish a bullish narrative right now unless we can rally and get above this 8 200 level and even then it doesn't tell me necessarily that i think new highs are coming it just means that we could be looking at a situation where this is just consolidation in the first half of the cycle right because we haven't dropped below this may 17th and may 18th low yet so we could just be consolidating for half a cycle and then go higher that that's a possibility so i want to first see a move back above 81 8200 that gets us back above obviously the 10 day but it gets us back above the 20-day moving average which we have not done since really dropping sharply a week or so ago until that happens i really don't want to get excited but also on the on the bearish side you know we've again we've got this beautiful uptrend there's no point in being extremely bearish or concerned right now until we see some key levels broken and some key levels i would say would be these wicks kind of below the past six trading days okay we've got some attempts to sell the market that have failed they've seen some good reversals we've got some green candles here some hammer looking candles so the market has tried to sell off and has reversed but we still have the short term so declining structure in place so that is the reason why i want to just be mindful on the downside to a loss of this line thinks gets me thinking that yeah i think we could be like breaking down now we've consolidated after these two big candles consolidated for a week now dropping lower ultimately a drop below this may 18th candle opens the possibility for some prices deep into the six thousand dollar range and potentially opens the the door for a five thousand handle so something in the five thousand dollar range don't expect that soon but again loss of this line and a loss of this other line here drawn from the may 18th lows opens up some more of the downside opportunity and potential and again don't forget even though this is so bullish there's plenty of room from a profit taking standpoint and retracement for the market to come back down because as a result so um i think overall what i'm doing with this information is simply saying that i need to see more evidence of a short-term directional move for me to put my capital at work at the moment i still want to be denominated in bitcoin because i think surprises if they come will be to the upside and i don't want to be sitting in a usdt type asset if the market does rocket from here to something like this and it might be hard to get a good leverage position so at least they'll have my position um again i believe in the bull markets and even if we do go lower and form a cycle low this month or next month i still firmly believe that bitcoin will come back up it'll test the highs and make new highs that have been in the ten thousand dollar range and above at some point by the end of the year so i don't want to lose my position from a long standpoint as well okay let's move to a weekly and see if the weekly can give us any more insight and and what i see here obviously again is this beautiful move over almost three months okay so we've gone up 180 in three months and people are nervous about a couple of red candles just i mean this this move back here is orderly it is um sort of a consolidation more than it is a massive sell-off yes it could lead to a sell-off at the end at the tail end of that move but right now this just looks like the market consolidating these gains uh this um candle here uh it's not really a doji but sort of reversal looking candle and then followed by a followed by a nice red bar to form a swing high so we have a swing high in place swing high is where we make a high and then the following week we reverse and we make and close below the lowest point of that candle so right here we have a classic swing high this tells me that this is a at least a short-term top of some type so um again going back to our daily chart we saw that and let's go to the daily all right so we have these two red candles representing possibly two different 60 day cycles and flipping to the weekly then we form so 60 day high low quick high again which means we have possibly out to july for the next cycle low this is the bearish interpretation again on the weekly chart so here it is here so looking at the next cycle low not coming into a july meaning that we consolidate here over one two three four around about five to six more weeks that would be for me bullish the question is can we consolidate in an orderly structure to set up the next big move if we can do something like this that works really well for me and then continue the market higher that's what i was describing on the daily chart on the weekly chart um this would be a move back towards the 20 week moving average in my not even be that severe of course it's hard to say and it's hard to draw these lines in the weekly but you get the point here that we're looking at this consolidation now any move higher again i think if it takes out this bar which is getting close to the highs but taking out the bar here at around about 8700 is certainly a bullish development and one for us to get long again all right spent a few minutes just going over the open positions here and they also cover three of the majors as well so that's good looking at ethereum btc so um i moved back down here so i did talk about the bollinger bands getting tight a move coming so far the move has been lower so let's see now if this is the end of this slight move lower kind of a bearish trap in some ways and then a move higher i'm not as as keen on this anymore i think if um if it was heading high it would have moved by now it's been a lot of time consolidating but again just give it some room here not too far away from the entry point as well top the stop is nice and tight i'm not giving it a whole lot of room here to go lower got my stop set not too far below the candle here on may 30th that week lower if it gets stopped out it's not going to really hurt it's a very small loss if it goes higher than the potential here is for a good 25 to sort of 40 percent move in a very short period of time so the uh the reward is set up well it's just a matter of whether or not this can can resolve itself higher not too keen on this one at the moment looking at uh it's got a ripple a similar type of thing here um a little more um a little more risk here i think the entry is just above the may 27th candle but again not a huge risk got my stop set just below the may 26 candle if price gets back back to that level there's no point in being in the trade and and this narrative would be uh would be pretty much uh negated looks like the bollinger bands are getting tight again but similar to ethereum we've got these four candles lower but still at the 10 and 20 day moving average everything is getting really tight i can see this popping up very sharply and fast but i could also see this moving lower fairly quickly as well point being that i think eventually this is going to resolve itself in the direction it wants it wants to go in and that move will continue for probably you know maybe three or four weeks so um just watching out for that but again nice tight stop not giving it too much room if it gets below that line marked on this chart there's no reason to be in the trade so again a reasonable reasonably well structured risk reward type opportunity it's just a matter of what the market gives us at that point we're not we're at the mercy of the market from then going forward and now lastly let's look at litecoin and litecoin is doing really really well this is so far a 15 percent move from the entry it's around about a 30 percent move from the breakout um so it's it's a great position right now again i think this probably pulls back a little bit at some point but if you look at what it did sort of from december all the way up to april it uh it didn't give much of a pullback in each of these cases it kind of consolidated more than it pulled back we do have some pullbacks but those pullbacks led to a significant more upside and it looks like now we've started something similar again um so i think look for consolidation now and then move higher i don't want to give up my position here i could take some profit and let the rest ride but i think um i think this is the type of trade where we can just manage the the manage the risk for a a rolling stop standpoint um right now you can definitely move your stops to sort of break even point um and then as it creates these layers or step ups we can find where it makes logical sense to place the stop based on the idea that if the if litecoin reversed then it would uh reaching a certain point would negate the uptrend and right now it might be you might be able to move it to the lows of june 7th but there's plenty of room right here let it run for now don't be impatient with stuff like this see what happens is um so here's here's my three positions ethereum ripple and litecoin a lot of people in this type of case will take the profit on litecoin and say let me double up on ripple and ethereum because they haven't moved yet and i think that's wrong i think that's the wrong way of looking at it if anything you want to be ready to cut your ethereum and ripple positions even if it means a break even and not not participating in the upside and playing something like litecoin you want to stick with your winners don't cut your winners early in a market like this just to go to to a position that has a moved yet okay the ones that haven't moved you haven't moved for a reason most of the time that's because you know the market doesn't want it to move or is is looking at maybe uh reversing lower and and and not going with your primary outlook so if your trade hasn't gone in your direction in your favor quickly from the beginning there's a good chance it's never going to do that whereas something like litecoin that just confirms your view and moves higher you don't want to be giving those up because something like this especially when you have the three months before of a nice trend you know majors do something like this for us okay and that's it's shown the ability to do that before it's showing us that it's wanting to do that right now so why would you want to cut that so early give it a chance to give you this and this here would be a 60 and 70 and 80 move so if you've got you know a good allocation to that a 70 or 80 percent winner in your portfolio even when you are very very tight on risk can do you can do wonders of course it goes without saying so a little lesson on just viewing your winners as them being winners and wanting to ride the winners and not cut them down early that's been your update for the cycles for the week i'll have a top 10 market report out on wednesday happy trading and all the best
