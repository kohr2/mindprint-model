Good morning Bitcoin Live members. it's Bob Lucas on April the 24th. hope you're doing really well. so I have a bit of a change in format now going forward. the Friday lightning report was just getting far too big for me to handle, too many requests and I think a lot of the coins were simply not coins that people were necessarily following. so what I'm going to do here is change the Wednesday which Wednesday report, which has been typically a midweek update on Bitcoin and some of the other majors that may be moving, and make that a top 10 market report. so Monday will be the full Bitcoin cycles report, going over the daily and weekly chart. Wednesday will now be the top 10 coin report, where I cover the top 10 coins, and then Friday's lightning report will be 15 coins- 15 maybe to 20 at the most of coins outside of the top 10, and they can be any market cap based on feedback from you and what you want to see. so I will be monitoring the comment section for now, going forward, let's start with this post and the comments in that post and the requests that you have in terms of looking at altcoins and seeing where there may be some opportunity. so please post your requests in the comments. I will also skim through, before the report, my list that I've gone through in the past for lightning reports and take a look at anything that I believe is of interest. so something that could be a potential setup, something that should be on your watch list, something that has the room or the opportunity to go to go higher. so that's the new format. I think that's going to work a lot better than sort of a 40 or 50 minute lightning report. this way I'll get to spend a little more time on the analysis as well, and especially the top 10. here I'll get a chance to be more focused on those coins going forward because there will be a weekly recurring deeper dive into those. okay, so that's the update. I will just use coin market caps- US dollar coin market cap- to to find the top 10. obviously, tether will not be part of that. so number 11, tron, will be part of the top 10 and today I'll go through each of those for you as well as bitcoin. sit back and enjoy. okay, the btc update. well, bitcoin, I think, still looks great to me. we are touching the upper and actually have exceeded the upper bollinger bands. we had this tightening, rising but tightening uh process over the last few weeks. I said on Monday that I liked this setup. I thought this can still go higher and indeed on Tuesday we did go considerably higher, another sort of 200 higher. so this is still trending higher coming back today and it could go back a few more days. but, um, the fact that we are comfortably above the 10 and 20 day moving average, riding the upper bollinger bands- still relatively- I wouldn't call it early in the cycle, but at least before the typical midpoint of the cycle- I think that overall is a reason to at least remain bullish here or at least expect to continue the uptrend until we see evidence that that uptrend is no longer in play. while price remains in this type of trend, you want to respect that. you want to either be just uh long from a, from a long-term position and not necessarily leverage, but you don't want to be looking for shorts. picking tops in any uptrend is a mugs game or a losers game. don't, don't fall for that it is. it is a a nice feeling to think that you may be able to pick tops in an uptrend, but, um, you know, trust me, it, it, it. you will get one eventually and you'll feel good about it, but in the long run you'll get cut to death. trying to short a market that is rallying at this, best to wait for a nice trend lower to emerge, whether it's late in the cycle to short, otherwise you want to be riding with the trend at this time. at the moment it's still higher now. if the cycle low was right here on the day 47, then today marks day 30, which is around the midpoint. so we are getting kind of into that danger period or the period where it could start to turn lower. but again, we still need to see evidence that it's going to turn lower. we still have- we have, for god's sake, five month highs right here on this candle, uh yesterday. so, uh, with five month highs just in place, you don't want to be shorting the market at this point, all right. let's take a look at ethereum here. don't like what i saw overnight. i was liking the action a couple days ago but really thinking now that my long ethereum trade is going to get stopped out here, such as the nature of the markets, but the fact that we dropped back below the 10 and 20 day moving average, um, when it should have continued higher from right this area here after after retracing the breakout point. i think coming back a second time to the breakout point is not a good sign at all. so, um, not looking good here. i think it still has a final chance. it's really going to move today or tomorrow. to be honest, with you not looking good, i think by friday we're either going to be closed out or stopped out, or sharply higher. at that point i don't think it's going to, i don't think it's going to hang around this area for too much longer. the bollinger bands are starting to get really tight and i think it's either going to break down pretty sharply and come back down to the 140 area, or it's going to break considerably higher. at this point, something to watch out for. but, uh, yeah, just unfortunately, just not not following through. and that's the way markets- um, you know markets- behave. it sometimes just got to look back at it and say: well, you know, was the chart pattern correct? was my entry correct? was my risk defined? well, if all those boxes are ticked correctly, then it's just a matter of accepting what the market gives us. and then, looking at ethereum to btc- see, this here is part of the problem as well. we are now, uh, breaking lower. uh, i'm not sure if we have new lows, necessarily, but, um, let's just draw across here. no, we're not. well, actually that bounced off, perfectly, almost so bounced off, uh. 029740973. okay, so almost a double bottom here from uh, this february low, still nowhere near the december lows. i think they're going to hold, but it looks like here we are going to exceed this february low and come down lower. so, overall, not exciting action here. um, from ethereum, and i think this is also telling us a lot of what we're seeing on the uh, the altcoin space in general, where a lot of charts have broken down, and we'll go over that on friday, but many of the charts are now broken down. uh, i think whatever altcoin move we've had is now over. for the time being. i think we're looking at retracing, but, uh, opportunities will come again, of course, but right now this looks like it's- uh, it's it's testing lower, probably a bounce back up, maybe something like this, and then, as we head lower into the next cycle low for bitcoin in may, i think we may get down to kind of this area here by the end of may where the bitcoin cycle low is due, and then we can build up again from there. so at the moment, not looking good here for ethereum going forward now. i really wish i had shorted xrp ripple here. i've pretty much been all over this move for, i would say, three months. my analysis has been very consistent: that we have a well-defined downtrend that you should respect, that you should not buy and that you should not be taking a position thinking that you'll get this big spike up at any given time. this is a perfect example of why you don't try and pick bottoms in a downtrend and you don't try and pick tops in an uptrend. it's a fool's game. as i said with the bitcoin analysis, this is a downtrend and when it got to this area in march, that downtrend begin began to accelerate lower. now we're- now we're putting in some deeper candles here. i think it's probably oversold enough. probably we'll get a bounce. but again, you don't play a bounce in this type of market because the downtrend, the trend on the longer time frame, intermediate time frame- is still lower. we've broken below this sort of arbitrary support line that i have here intersecting two prior points. nothing significant about those two points. we've had other periods like this one here where it's gone significantly lower. i think there isn't much of an opportunity here unless we get down to this sort of 4 000 level on on ripple versus bitcoin um. so you know- and now that we're sort of seem to be capitulating almost- that that decline could um could begin to really accelerate, as it has more recently, but almost become a complete sort of swan swan dive drop all the way down to the 4 000 area, maybe down at this 4 000 area. if it does find the bottom and reverse, put in a swing low, then maybe there's an opportunity to get long, but right now this is something you want to avoid. bitcoin cash, abc um. it's been performing well lately. it's, uh, more than doubled against bitcoin of late. it has somewhat of an uptrend in play. but unfortunately, if you look at more recent action here- let's see if we can take a look at this- so we had a top on this spike. we had a retrace back towards the 10- 20 day moving average. that's great. it tried to go higher again, failed to make a new high and now has made a new low. so that's a definition of a trend change right there. so we have a high that did not make a higher high. then we now have a breakdown and a low that's made a lower low, so this has to be respected. i think this is going to continue to come down low at this point. this also has a lot to do with bitcoin's- uh, more more dominant run of late, so this pair is probably showing more weakness because bitcoin is showing more strength than anything else and you probably will see that show up a little more here on the dollar chart. see, on the dollar chart we don't have a new high like same as bitcoin, but yet we do not have a lower low, and that's because bitcoin itself has performed really well as opposed to the dollar. so versus the dollar, this list is looking more, a little bit more like a flag pattern. tightening bollinger bands could go higher, but you would probably still need bitcoin to come back a little bit. i'm not sure if that's the case. so this is kind of a neutral chart for me. um, if if bitcoin versus abc here had held the line as well, then i would think this would be more bullish. but this development here leads me to believe it's starting to break down a little bit as well, and especially if bitcoin starts to find the top in this cycle, a 60 day cycle, the entire sector will get dragged down. i think this will also suffer. uh on on the bitcoin versus abc, but also a bitcoin versus the dollar chart as well. i think this would begin to break down. so at the moment, caution. not a horrible looking chart overall, um, but certainly something to be cautious about and i don't really see much of an opportunity to trade this at this time. okay, eos: i said uh before that this chart was looking good- eos versus dollar, that it was consolidating bounds again. bands were getting tighter- but it's gone the other way. this also is uh something we're seeing across the board now in many of the altcoins. eos is breaking down. this is a sign. uh, now, for long term, i'm not phased at all. this is a beautiful move off the dollar 50.. i think this will come back now quite a bit maybe into this sort of cluster. three dollar range- not a reason to get out from a long-term perspective. from a shorter term trading standpoint, you want to be out now. this is breaking down and not something you want to uh be long for. from a trade standpoint, eos- btc is showing a more pronounced, significant drop below any sort of level. i said before. that would be, um, something to get me out of. so this is now: and avoid, do not be trading this at all. eos is breaking down, could retrace back kind of all the way down to this sort of level here, even down to this initial point triangle point where it broke out. uh, anything's possible, especially if the altcoin space is going to have another month or so down. um, you know, i think i think people got very excited about the altcoin space recently, pretty much put a lot of money and capital back to work, and now i think this is taking some of that back. all right, litecoin, very similar trends, big up trends- are now breaking down. um, another reason why we use stops: right, uh, here's another point where i said: if you're going to go long, get long, but you want to be out at that point if it breaks below, lower, and this is the reason why we use stops. we always want to minimize our risk. if you're still holding this, then you know, i don't know it could bounce back, but you won't. you don't want to be holding these. if you're just trading these, if you're going to be, if you're, if you're investing long term, of course you don't care about these types of charts. but if you're trading this, then you should have been out right here. minimize your losses. you take it, taking a small loss, and move on. right now you're holding the bag on a 15- 20 loss here on the position and that hurts and it's probably hard to get out because of that. my advice is just always cut your losses and get out if it's if it's gone beyond your initial plan, because what happens is if it keeps going much lower than you and eventually end up puking that position because the losses are so steep that you can't handle it anymore. so if you're in that position, i would advise personally to to get out of it at the moment. no trade here long. it's come back a very long way. it needs to re-establish some type of uptrend. right now it's completely broken that trend. it's below previous sort of consolidation areas where they rallied. this would have been kind of the final straw area. see right here: um, getting below that and even the wick that you saw on this massive candle here. even that it's below that. so nothing here of interest for litecoin. it's now a broken uptrend and we don't know if this means that this trend will spend a period of time doing something like this. okay, over the next month or two before forming a new low. this was a beautiful move, but all beautiful moves, at least in the short term- intermediate trend come to an end, and this one looks like it has come to an end. okay, binance coin is about the only coin that still has an uptrend in play. but be careful with this, right? let's put in here: so: higher high: that's the last high versus the most recent high, versus the high before. higher high: that's great. now you want to put in some point here on the recent low. okay, so that's your stop point, right. if it gets below that point, you now have a trend change. it's still looking pretty good. it's at the 10 and 20 day moving average. what concerns me, though, is that all the other coins and all the other majors have pretty much already broken down, and this has had a very big move since november. it hasn't really stopped going higher, so at some point there's going to be some really significant profit taking. you would think it's something like this: it's up 400 and there's a lot of people who are sitting on some really fat gains on this, and once the momentum changes and turns, then you'll see a massive- you know- deceleration and sell off. it doesn't mean it's bearish for binance in the longer term, but everything has an ebb and flow, action to it and at some point this will have a reversal back. think of it like a pendulum swinging. at some point, once the pendulum reaches the other end, it starts to come back and get and gather momentum. that's what will happen eventually. i'm not saying it's gonna happen now, but, based on the whole crypto space in general and how it's already turned, you would want to, you'd want to believe, or you should believe, that this is probably going to turn at some point. at the moment, still like the uptrend, just keep, keep, you know, be aware of some of these important areas, certainly for breaks and closes on a daily below the 10 and 20 day moving average, you should be concerned on this xlm, i can't believe this is a top 10 coin, but it is. guys, be careful of this. this is not a good looking chart. i think it's breaking down. i think we're seeing the start of it right here. we had this. here it's more. it's not a bear flag but, um, when the entire space rallies sharply and this barely made a, you know, i mean it's up 50, don't get me wrong, but compared to everything else, um, it didn't do as much. and now we have a 10 day moving average below the 20. it's touching the lower bollinger bands. the entire space is breaking down. uh, i think this is going to go much lower. it may even test, in my opinion, the february lows by the time this move is over with. so be very careful with stella. i do not like this at all. cardano, look at this, guys, all the way back to the breakout point. okay, and- and there's a couple of things i just want to mention here and hopefully, as being members of bitcoin live, part of what we want to do, and certainly what i want to do, is not spoon feed ideas and trades that i'm doing, necessarily, but to teach you or to at least, uh, walk through the process and the thinking behind what i do and the trades i do. that's the most important takeaway, and what i said clearly and multiple times with ada was that we get in early on these chart identification patterns and we start to take our profit. we took some profit up in this sort of 1600 and then, somewhere around the 1800 area, we took two-thirds of the profit on this banked a really good profit. but some people- i know this because i got some emails or some texts, um some some dms, i should say- on asking what we should do. um, some people were kind of looking at this upper area. i certainly was, but i was looking at that upper area with a third, a final third, of my position, not with my profits. i took enough of the profits out where i didn't mind seeing this come back down lower. obviously didn't want to see it come back lower, but the point is that i was prepared for this lower by taking some profit early. of course, it's more of an art form than it is a science in terms of how much profit taken when you take it, but the fact that you know when the market gives you something, you want to take something off the table to allow you to then be able to weather something like this. i think what some people end up doing here is some people didn't buy the initial break of this. they bought this break here and now they're at break even and if they keep holding that full position now, they're going to end up probably puking out at a loss when they sat on the 30 and 40 profit. so just be aware of that. uh, if you are in that boat where you bought in at the breakout and have not sold anything, then i got to be honest with you. i think you start to get out here, take your break even and and use that as a lesson, because what's going to happen is, or what could happen is, this could continue higher all the way back down to this march and february lows and let's extend that out. okay, it could come back all the way to here and i think you would end up puking your position right, probably when the market's going to turn. so just be aware of that. but look as analysis, i don't necessarily like much about this and i think this is just again a symptom of the entire all coin space. it's going through a correction at the moment and this could find support right here, potentially at least maybe come back up for a few days, like something like this, right, but then i think, based on this, it's going to come back down lower and break below that point. so something to be aware of. okay, let's finish with coin number 10 on the market cap tron. so overall, this is a beautiful base, right, but again, failed breakout here and now it came back down, tried to come back up, didn't do anything and is now breaking down, touching the lower bollinger bands for the second time. this, like everything else, is a warning, i think. if we go back and look at the february and march, like we did, ada, i think we are looking at a retest of that zone. let's draw that here. so somewhere in this area here over the next coming month would probably be a good position again to trying and maybe establish a position and then we're looking at maybe a retest of this sort of neckline or this zone, at least probably not until june or july on the next cycle, and then maybe a break higher and above. so for now, this is an avoid. long term again, like anything else, these are good positions to be in price wise, but the charts are not showing any trade opportunity from a, you know, short and intermediate term time frame for tron. okay, guys, let's finish with a little summary here. summary is that bitcoin is performing well, but the entire altcoin space is underperforming and actually in the corrective mode. all the charts are bearish, some of the altcoins that we're not covering today, so the top sort of uh 10 to 30 market cap coins are showing horrible chart patterns. be very aware, guys. you want to be um, sitting on the sidelines for this. let the market correct. don't try and find bottoms in a downtrend. this downtrend has only really just gotten started. it hasn't um, it hasn't really been in play for a significant amount of time yet, even though there's pretty significant corrections already. uh, you see that i'm on the sidelines, have been mostly on the sidelines for a number of weeks now, for that very reason. when the charts start breaking down, then there just isn't a trade for me to have. a lot of. you are trying to force your hand on the market, trying to force the situation, and you have recency bias in mind, meaning that you loved the- uh, the, the uptrend of the last few months, the, the profits that you were showing, at least on paper, um, and now you kind of uh, longing for those days again and trying to pick up these, uh, these coins. on pullbacks, not the time for that. i think we still have more of a pullback to come. be patient, sit in cash, sit in bitcoin, if you have to, um, and let's just wait for opportunities to present themselves. they will come, but we need to be selective and mindful and patient to be able to capitalize, because what happens is it's so easy to make a good run, a good profit, in an altcoin run-up and it's so easy to give it all back and more. okay, so please think about that, incorporate that into your strategy and incorporate that more into your thinking. when you're looking for a trade, ask yourself: what am i doing here? if i'm looking for something, then i'm probably taking inferior setups and i'm taking a trade that's not ticking all of my boxes and you're taking a trade just for the sake of trading. so try to avoid that and be mindful. hopefully you like this new format. the top 10 coin review on wednesdays. give me your requests for all coins for the friday lightning report. until then, be well and happy trading.
