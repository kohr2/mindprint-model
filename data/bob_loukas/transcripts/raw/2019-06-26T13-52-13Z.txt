Good morning, Bitcoin Live members. It's Bob Lucas. It is Wednesday, the 26th of June. Hope you're doing really well. This is your top 10 market cap report. Going to start with Bitcoin. I think most of the video will be Bitcoin because the majors are just not moving versus BTC. Doing well against the dollar and I'll get into that a little more again. But let's take a quick look at Bitcoin. And there are a few words to describe the strength that we're seeing here. I know a lot of people want to understand why and how Bitcoin got to $13,000 in the space of a few months. And to be honest with you, I think the answer is simply that there is just a rush of new money, of money wanting to accumulate Bitcoin at these lower levels. And there just is not enough supply. There is actually very little supply to go around. I think people underestimate the huddle nature of Bitcoin. And I've covered this in many videos in the past. There's just not enough out there now. There's a scramble for Bitcoin. This move is not even all that speculative just yet. People are in disbelief. I talk to friends, acquaintances, even many of your members from time to time. And I know that most people are under allocated or did not get the position looking for lower lows back in February. Um, was surprised when in April the market jumped. And I think ever since this big jump right here in April, when it went from 4,000 up to 5,000, I think people just still expected it to move lower to get a position. And then it's just gone up since and it's gone up since. And this is a disbelief rally. And I've said this on Twitter as well, best, best type of bull market is a bull market in disbelief. And people continue to short this market thinking there's a 20 or 30% pullback and they're forced to cover and buy back at a higher price. And that's repeating itself and repeating itself. And I will repeat myself right now, as I've said every week, yes, there is a 30 to 40% correction coming at some point, but we don't know from where. And we said this at 7,000 and said this at the nine, eight, 9,000 level. Now I'm saying it again here at 2,800. The market is extended. It is overbought. But again, in a massive bull market move, overbought means very little. Um, the market can and does move ahead for extended periods of time, well beyond what we believe is possible. And we're seeing that right now here in this market, we are seeing a decent separation now between the 10 day moving average and price. Typically when it gets this high, let me see if I can turn some Bollinger bands on. Yeah. So we're riding the upper Bollinger bands. We're well above the Bollinger bands here. I think we could be now in that final move coming out of this consolidation here. You'll see every time we consolidate, we move nicely consolidate. I've been waiting for this. Um, I think we could be getting towards the end of this move, but you know what, the end of this move could be 14,000 could even be 15,000 full. I know that's how, uh, that's just how the Bitcoin moves at this point in a, in a rally. Um, so now I'm still along half of my position, the leverage position from the 8,300 area right here. When it broke back above the 10 day moving average, uh, took some profit near the 10,000 area, just to kind of, um, cement my other position long to be able to hold and I'm still holding. And this has been the best trade easily this year, uh, up 50, 50% in a leverage market. You know, you can do the math. Hopefully many of you are riding this with me. It is, uh, added a significant amount of BTC to my underlying portfolio, but I'm still riding this. Look at this. The price, as I record is still shooting higher at 29, uh, 2900 right now, almost. So, um, letting this go now, my stops overnight at 10, 9, uh, 50, right below this candle right here. Uh, that's now already $2,000 below the current action. So I'm going to look for another logical spot right here. And I think this might be it here at 11, right below this four hour candle. Um, I'm going to have to try and make it tight right now. I think, I mean, might have to give up the position in a, in a, in a tight decline. Uh, I don't want to just cash in right here. I mean, logically, somebody may be thinking, just, just sell now and, you know, get, get all your, your profit in here. But like I said, I don't know if this can go to 15,000 and that's another 20% move from here. So I'm going to play it maybe just a little bit tighter. Let's go with the bottom of this candle here, 11, 640. So 11,600 now becomes, and will become for me, uh, my other or my next stop for this position here. So, uh, right below here, giving up $40 on the candle just as a buffer. Okay. And then, you know, just take up, I'll probably be updating this daily from now on if it continues on this trajectory, because we're on, we're on the path now where I think we're in that final stage where once it tops, it'll come back fairly quickly in a V. Um, so I don't think we get another consolidation right now. I think we could be looking at sort of the intermediate level top could be wrong. Could just be looking at maybe a drop down and then a sideways consolidation for a couple of weeks and then go again. That has been the nature of this market. I don't want to dictate how it's going to behave. All I know is that we have an amazing uptrend in play and you would be absolutely foolish to think you can short this market. Uh, you may get lucky shorting it, but it's just a foolish move in general and selling your underlying BTC as well. Not as foolish, but I think it's up there as well. Uh, I think you just want to hold your BTC. You don't have to be leveraged long, but just hold your BTC because you just don't know what this market's going to do at this point. All right. So that's the top 10. Sorry. That's the BTC, um, analysis. I'm going to get into the top 10 right now. Um, again, I think B BTC is where it's all at, and, uh, you'll see that in some of the top 10 charts here, but of course we could be looking at a change soon. Let's get into it. Okay. So here, before I get started in the top 10, I'm going to fly through these top 10 today. The charts all look similar, uh, versus BTC. They are all pretty much down and down considerably. So that tells me that this is all about BTC. Now some will argue that all these alts are doing really well against the U S dollar. So they'll point out, um, they'll show me some charts on the, on the U S dollar. And I do agree, but that's only because BTC is up massively against the dollar. And as these top 10 somewhat hold that level against BTC, actually, they're not holding it. They're actually falling, but they're not falling as fast as BTC is rising versus the dollar. And that's the reason why versus the dollar, some of these charts look decent and actually some are breaking out and some are making gains, but versus BTC, they are all declining, which means that the play has been to say be long BTC and out of these alts and not look at these from, Hey, I'm in these alts. So I'm doing fine. You know, versus the dollar. No, you would have been doing much better versus the, uh, versus the dollar. If you were in BTC. Now that rotation is going to come sooner or later, but the reason why I haven't been in almost any trade for almost three months now, except for the occasional one, like light coin, I wasn't a theorem and a ripple that both got stopped out, but mostly because I just don't like the charts and I not the type that's going to buy perceived value. In my opinion, in the crypto world, there's nothing of the sort. There is no such thing as intrinsic, intrinsic value in some of these coins. I'm not going to buy them just because they look cheap or they're, they're cheap relative to where they were last six months of the last year. I will wait for decent reversals, clean looking reversal charts and patterns. I will look for a swing back in the 10 day moving average, even across above the 20. I'll look for a trend line, a declining trend line break. So essentially I'm willing to give up 30 to 40% of the move because I know when the alts get started and they go in certain direction, they can double and triple and quadruple in price versus BTC over a month period. So I don't care if, um, if many say, Hey, you missed the initial move. That's fine. I missed the 60% decline as well, uh, because I wasn't in it. Right. So it works both ways. I preserve my capital first, then I, uh, I'm worried about earning, uh, second. And if I can preserve my capital first and then get some big winners, like we have right now in the leverage BTC trade, then everything takes care of itself. That's just simply the way, uh, I like to trade. And I think most successful traders do it the same way. Pick your winners, ride your winners, ride them to the end. Um, stay away from the losers. And the old coins have been losers. Let's look at a theorem here as first. All right. So we're heading back down towards this may lows. If theorems held up somewhat, okay. When you compare it to many of the other alts, but we are now kind of back in this December 17th low area. We pissed it recently. Um, sorry, December 18 lows. We pit pierced it briefly recently here in the may lows and we rallied high and we come back down. Could be looking at somewhat of a double bottom here. I don't know. Like I said, I want to see a reversal. It is oversold. So even a bounce back to this 0.028, uh, or 0.029 level is only kind of, uh, a dead cat bounce level. You really want to see it back well above the 20 day moving average. So something, you know, kind of like this, uh, let me get my proper drawing tool out. Something like this there. And at that point, once it kind of breaks back above the high again, then we can look for a trend change. So at the moment I'm avoiding this. Um, look, if you like this project from a law, if you like a theorem from a long-term perspective and you want to get some more allocation, then that's the only time I will somewhat buy the value argument, right? Because it has a history down at this level at finding some support. Um, so I can kind of buy that narrative because we're looking for the zoom all the way out. You've got a point right here in December at the peak of Bitcoin, Bitcoin's a bull market. Then you have another almost attempt down here in September. You have another balance right here in December piercing right here. So we've got, we've got some decent or significant support in this area. And one could argue that maybe this level will hold, or if not, if you're buying for the very long term, that this may not be a bad point. So that is, uh, that that's something I would say for long-term holders only for trading though. If you're just trading this to me, it looks like it could still go lower in the short term. And again, I want to see a reversal before I get excited. All right. Ripple. Another reason why we use stop losses and we don't get concerned about being wrong on the stop. Stops are always right. If you have a stop in place, it saves you. Even if you get out, even if you get stopped out and it goes higher, it's okay. It happens every now and then. If it means you get to avoid losing, you know, another third of your Bitcoin because of move like this. So, you know, we took a trade here, went long, it came back down and took out the lows and we're out. Okay. No fuss. Took a small loss, but we didn't take a big loss. And now people are sitting in these positions thinking, well, this has got to be the low. It's got to be the low. Yeah, it could be the low. It's definitely somewhat, definitely is oversold. But you know what? It's been in decline really since December. Six months of decline and only just pierced these lows, low here and low here. So, you better hope that it's just a bear trap at this point. I'm going to go higher because beyond that, if I zoom all the way out, your next sort of point is all the way down here. And that's another 70% decline from where we are. So be aware of that. Again, I'm looking, I don't like this chart. I think it's horrible. No reason for me to be in this long term or even trading standpoint. But again, doesn't mean it can't reverse. I'm just, just talking price action. And price action says, stay away. Bitcoin cash as well. It looks like maybe short term oversold may bounce slightly, but again, until it's see reversals, I'm not interested in the long side of this. EOS, I mean, this is a crash looking chart. Looks like we may want to go all the way back down to the December lows. Probably again, oversold short term may bounce to the 10 day moving average, but you'd have to respect trend and expect this. Not saying it's going to happen, but that's what the chart's telling me is going to happen. If it breaks higher and reverses and breaks that trend, then we can look to get long because there is a lot of upside still. There's almost a double from the point 0075 area. So just wait for it. Don't force your hand on something like this. All right, Litecoin. Now, this is interesting. And I think this I'm being repetitive, but I like to talk out loud about sort of lessons in trading more so for myself than anything else. But this also is another classic example of not falling for a narrative to the point where it affects your portfolio. Now, a narrative is great. A narrative is essential in many cases to forming a trade idea that you can execute and then plan towards a reward. And the narrative in this case was that we're pumping here because of course, Litecoin is going to experience a halving event in the next month or so. And that has been a bullish in the past and there's no reason why it wouldn't be bullish again. So, you know, we held this position, took some profit early, bought another position right here in this consolidation area before it launched higher. And the position was well and truly profitable. And then started reversing and broke below the 10 day moving average, broke slightly below the 20 day moving average. I stayed in the position right here. It rallied up, but then I put in a hard stop right at this level. And the argument was that if it gets back down, if it doesn't continue higher from there and starts to break down, that there's something wrong with the chart and something wrong with Litecoin's narrative. So we got out right here, took some profit. Okay. It wasn't as big. It was just kind of a, sort of a 10, 12% move. I think it was on the entry, nothing to, to sneeze about, but look at ever since there have been a lot of people. And I know this because I get the messages, a lot of people who have held thinking, Hey, you're crazy. It's, it's the, it's the halving event, right? The halving events, it's going to go to 0.025 or 0.03, even Litecoin's going to go crazy. And then we've just had nothing but red candles. We're down 50%. I mean, from, from the stop down, almost 50% from the stop. This is crash type material. Now, I don't know where the bottom is for this. If you look, if you zoom out, I mean, there is no bottom in sight. Okay. It is oversold just like the others. It could well bounce all the way back up to 0.013, but you have to respect this trend. You have to respect what the charts telling me. We have a high right here. Okay. We have, we have another high right here. That's below that. Okay. We have a low right here and we have a low now, a new one that has exceeded. That's a big change in trend, even on an intermediate timeframe, going back over a few months. So, I mean, price doesn't lie. The chart doesn't lie. It is what it is. You want to believe a narrative. That's fine, but, uh, I'm not going to do it with my money. That's for sure. So I live another day with this one. I may even get in at some point, but again, look for a change in trend. It is oversold significantly and a move back up to, you know, kind of 0.013 is a 30% move. That's not my type of play. I'm not trying to catch a knife in this area because I know some people try to catch a knife with other other candles right here. We could easily see one more big candle lower, even from here down like this before it goes up. Okay. So there's, it's hard to catch a low when the market is moving significantly lower like this. A lesson for, for you, I hope. Yeah. Binance is one of the coins that is held holding up really nicely. So against the USD, it's doing really well as a result. Um, but no, no clear cut sign here. It is, it is forming lower highs, as you can see somewhat lower lows. That's sort of a broadening broadening, uh, channel here almost, uh, that's kind of forming on this. It's very, not very clean, but it's possible that we are looking for a move down to the sort of bottom area now. Um, so overall, this is not a bullish chart. It's not as bearish as some of the other ones, and it has had a massive move, but it looks like now it's kind of in a declining phase if you can look at this. So I don't see where, where the long trade is in any of this. And I can see this now as it's starting to get going, I can see this making a considerable drop from here down to this lower area, a new low before finding any level of support. Very hard to say, but again, not something I want to be long. Stella. Well, I mean, how much do I hate this, this chart? I've hated this chart for months and months and months. I've been very vocal about this. I think if you listen to me, you would have saved yourself a lot of cash or a lot of BTC, nothing at all interests me about this. If you can short it, I would. It's oversold now, of course, but, um, just stay away from this. ADA is making new lows and anything making new lows is of no interest to me. It could be a little bear trap. Yes, it is oversold. Yes. But again, it doesn't really matter in the downtrend. Oversold in a downtrend is like overbought in an uptrend. It can just go and go and go on for a long period of time. Like the others, look for a reversal, look for a change in trend, look for a move back above the 10, 20 day moving average. Then we can start talking again. Yeah, Tron, Tron is in a downtrend still, clearly. Um, look for again, same analysis, look for a change in trend. It, the only good thing about Tron is it seems like it's still back in this bottom channel again. Um, and until it gets back out, there's really no trade to be had, but it's not as sick as some of the other ones you can see. It's still well above prices from December. Obviously, uh, nothing, no, we knew the highs, uh, but back into this channel. Again, I think this one can do well. Once the altcoins have their run, this can easily triple, uh, or double at least. You can even double from this, uh, 400 area of 400. So if you wait for confirmation above in this area of 400, a double is back to just the highest from January. So that's the type of move. See right here. That's the type of move you want to wait for eventually, but you want to wait to make sure that you're having a higher level of the highest. So that's the type of move. See right here. That's the type of move you want to wait for eventually, but you want to wait to make sure that you have a trend change in place because right now, the way this looks, if BTC continues to rally, then this could go down to 220 level first, and you would obviously have to pay a significant penalty and price for staying long, something like that. Okay. My friends, that's the top 10 report stick with BTC for now until we see otherwise all the best and wish you all the best and wish you all the great week.
